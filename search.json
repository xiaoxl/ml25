The usual way to make a computer do useful work is to have a human programmer write down rules — a computer program — to be followed to turn input data into appropriate answers. Machine Learning turns this around: the machine looks at the input data and the expected task outcome, and figures out what the rules should be. A Machine Learning system is trained rather than explicitly programmed. It’s presented with many examples relevant to a task, and it finds statistical structure in these examples that eventually allows the system to come up with rules for automating the task [2].",

    "section": "1.2 Types of Machine Learning Systems",
    "text": "1.2 Types of Machine Learning Systems\nThere are many different types of Machine Learning systems that it is useful to classify them in braod categories, based on different criteria. These criteria are not exclusive, and you can combine them in any way you like.\nThe most popular criterion for Machine Learning classification is the amount and type of supervision they get during training. In this case there are four major types.\nSupervised Learning The training set you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions. The machines learn from the data to alter the model to get the desired output. The main task for Supervised Learning is classification and regression.\nUnsupervised Learning In Unsupervised Learning, the data provided doesn’t have class information or desired solutions. We just want to dig some information directly from those data themselves. Usually Unsupervised Learning is used for clustering and dimension reduction.\nReinforcement Learning In Reinforcement Learning, there is a reward system to measure how well the machine performs the task, and the machine is learning to find the strategy to maximize the rewards. Typical examples here include gaming AI and walking robots.\nSemisupervised Learning This is actually a combination of Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning, that it is usually used to deal with data that are half labelled.\n\n1.2.1 Tasks for Supervised Learning\nAs mentioned above, for Supervised Learning, there are two typical types of tasks:\nClassification It is the task of predicting a discrete class labels. A typical classification problem is to see an handwritten digit image and recognize it.\nRegression It is the task of predicting a continuous quantity. A typical regression problem is to predict the house price based on various features of the house.\nThere are a lot of other tasks that are not directly covered by these two, but these two are the most classical Supervised Learning tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn this course we will mainly focus on Supervised Classification problems.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Classification based on complexity\nAlong with the popularity boost of deep neural network, there comes another classificaiton: shallow learning vs. deep learning. Basically all but deep neural network belongs to shallow learning. Although deep learning can do a lot of fancy stuffs, shallow learning is still very good in many cases. When the performance of a shallow learning model is good enough comparing to that of a deep learning model, people tend to use the shallow learning since it is usually faster, easier to understand and easier to modify.",

    "text": "1.3 Basic setting for Machine learning problems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe by default assume that we are dealing with a Supervised Classification problem.\n\n\n\n1.3.1 Input and output data structure\nSince we are dealing with Supervised Classification problems, the desired solutions are given. These desired solutions in Classification problems are also called labels. The properties that the data are used to describe are called features. Both features and labels are usually organized as row vectors.\n\nExample 1.1 The example is extracted from [3]. There are some sample data shown in the following table. We would like to use these information to classify bird species.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: Bird species classification based on four features\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeight (g)\nWingspan (cm)\nWebbed feet?\nBack color\nSpecies\n\n\n\n\n1000.100000\n125.000000\nNo\nBrown\nButeo jamaicensis\n\n\n3000.700000\n200.000000\nNo\nGray\nSagittarius serpentarius\n\n\n3300.000000\n220.300000\nNo\nGray\nSagittarius serpentarius\n\n\n4100.000000\n136.000000\nYes\nBlack\nGavia immer\n\n\n3.000000\n11.000000\nNo\nGreen\nCalothorax lucifer\n\n\n570.000000\n75.000000\nNo\nBlack\nCampephilus principalis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first four columns are features, and the last column is the label. The first two features are numeric and can take on decimal values. The third feature is binary that can only be \\(1\\) (Yes) or \\(0\\) (No). The fourth feature is an enumeration over the color palette. You may either treat it as categorical data or numeric data, depending on how you want to build the model and what you want to get out of the data. In this example we will use it as categorical data that we only choose it from a list of colors (\\(1\\) — Brown, \\(2\\) — Gray, \\(3\\) — Black, \\(4\\) — Green).\nThen we are able to transform the above data into the following form:\n\n\n\nTable 1.2: Vectorized Bird species data\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\nLabels\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\begin{bmatrix}1001.1 & 125.0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\n\n\\(\\begin{bmatrix}3000.7 & 200.0 & 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n\\(2\\)\n\n\n\\(\\begin{bmatrix}3300.0 & 220.3 & 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n\\(2\\)\n\n\n\\(\\begin{bmatrix}4100.0 & 136.0 & 1 & 3 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n\\(3\\)\n\n\n\\(\\begin{bmatrix}3.0 & 11.0 & 0 & 4 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n\\(4\\)\n\n\n\\(\\begin{bmatrix}570.0 & 75.0 & 0 & 3 \\end{bmatrix}\\)\n\\(5\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen the Supervised Learning problem is stated as follows: Given the features and the labels, we would like to find a model that can classify future data.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Parameters and hyperparameters\nA model parameter is internal to the model and its value is learned from the data.\nA model hyperparameter is external to the model and its value is set by people.\nFor example, assume that we would like to use Logistic regression to fit the data. We set the learning rate is 0.1 and the maximal iteration is 100. After the computations are done, we get a the model\n\\[\ny = \\sigma(0.8+0.7x).\n\\] The two cofficients \\(0.8\\) and \\(0.7\\) are the parameters of the model. The model Logistic regression, the learning rate 0.1 and the maximal iteration 100 are all hyperparametrs. If we change to a different set of hyperparameters, we may get a different model, with a different set of parameters.\nThe details of Logistic regression will be discussed later.\n\n\n1.3.3 Evaluate a Machine Learning model\nOnce the model is built, how do we know that it is good or not? The naive idea is to test the model on some brand new data and check whether it is able to get the desired results. The usual way to achieve it is to split the input dataset into three pieces: training set, validation set and test set.\nThe model is initially fit on the training set, with some arbitrary selections of hyperparameters. Then hyperparameters will be changed, and new model is fitted over the training set. Which set of hyperparameters is better? We then test their performance over the validation set. We could run through a lot of different combinations of hyperparameters, and find the best performance over the validation set. After we get the best hyperparameters, the model is selcted, and we fit it over the training set to get our model to use.\nTo compare our model with our models, either our own model using other algorithms, or models built by others, we need some new data. We can no longer use the training set and the validation set since all data in them are used, either for training or for hyperparameters tuning. We need to use the test set to evaluate the “real performance” of our data.\nTo summarize:\n\nTraining set: used to fit the model;\nValidation set: used to tune the hyperparameters;\nTest set: used to check the overall performance of the model.\n\nThe validation set is not always required. If we use cross-validation technique for hyperparameters tuning, like sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV(), we don’t need a separated validation set. In this case, we will only need the training set and the test set, and run GridSearchCV over the training set. The cross-validation will be discussed in Section 2.2.5.\nThe sizes and strategies for dataset division depends on the problem and data available. It is often recommanded that more training data should be used. The typical distribution of training, validation and test is \\((6:3:1)\\), \\((7:2:1)\\) or \\((8:1:1)\\). Sometimes validation set is discarded and only training set and test set are used. In this case the distribution of training and test set is usually \\((7:3)\\), \\((8:2)\\) or \\((9:1)\\).\n\n\n1.3.4 Workflow in developing a machine learning application\nThe workflow described below is from [3].\n\nCollect data.\nPrepare the input data.\nAnalyze the input data.\nTrain the algorithm.\nTest the algorithm.\nUse it.\n\nIn this course, we will mainly focus on Step 4 as well Step 5. These two steps are where the “core” algorithms lie, depending on the algorithm. We will start from the next Chapter to talk about various Machine Learning algorithms and examples.",

    "text": "1.4 Python quick guide\n\n1.4.1 Python Notebook\nWe mainly use Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) to write documents for this course. Currently most main stream Python IDEs support Jupyter Notebook. They are not entirely identical but the differences are not huge and you may choose any you like. In this course we recommand using VS Code. The setup can be found in Appendix Section A.1.\n\n\n1.4.2 Python fundamentals\nWe will put some very basic Python commands here for you to warm up. More advanced Python knowledge will be covered during the rest of the semester. The main reference for this part is [3]. Another referenece is My notes.\n\n1.4.2.1 Indentation\nPython is using indentation to denote code blocks. It is not convienent to write in the first place, but it forces you to write clean, readable code.\nBy the way, the if and for block are actually straightforward.\nif jj &lt; 3:\n    jj = jj \n    print(\"It is smaller than 3.\")\nif jj &lt; 3:\n    jj = jj\nprint(\"It is smaller than 3.\")\nfor i in range(3):\n    i = i + 1\n    print(i)\nfor i in range(3):\n    i = i + 1\nprint(i)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease tell the differences between the above codes.\n\n\n1.4.2.2 list and dict\nHere are some very basic usage of lists of dictionaries in Python.\n\nnewlist = list()\nnewlist.append(1)\nnewlist.append('hello')\nnewlist\n\n[1, 'hello']\n\n\n\nnewlisttwo = [1, 'hello']\nnewlisttwo\n\n[1, 'hello']\n\n\n\nnewdict = dict()\nnewdict['one'] = 'good'\nnewdict[1] = 'yes'\nnewdict\n\n{'one': 'good', 1: 'yes'}\n\n\n\nnewdicttwo = {'one': 'good', 1: 'yes'}\nnewdicttwo\n\n{'one': 'good', 1: 'yes'}\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2.3 Loop through lists\nWhen creating for loops we may let Python directly loop through lists. Here is an example. The code is almost self-explained.\n\nalist = ['one', 2, 'three', 4]\n\nfor item in alist:\n    print(item)\n\none\n2\nthree\n4\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2.4 Reading files\nThere are a lot of functions that can read files. The basic one is to read any files as a big string. After we get the string, we may parse it based on the structure of the data.\nThe above process sounds complicated. That’s why we have so many different functions reading files. Usually they focus on a certain types of files (e.g. spreadsheets, images, etc..), parse the data into a particular data structure for us to use later.\nI will mention a few examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotecsv files and excel files\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth of them are spreadsheets format. Usually we use pandas.read_csv and pandas.read_excel both of which are from the package pandas to read these two types of files. When reading excel, package openpyxl is needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteimages\n\n\n\n\n\nImages can be treated as matrices, that each entry represents one pixel. If the image is black/white, it is represented by one matrix where each entry represents the gray value. If the image is colored, it is represented by three matrices where each entry represents one color. To use which three colors depends on the color map. rgb is a popular choice.\nIn this course when we need to read images, we usually use matplotlib.pyplot.imread from the package matplotlib or cv.imread from the package opencv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2.5 Writing files\n\npandas.DataFrame.to_csv\npandas.DataFrame.to_excel\nmatplotlib.figure.Figure.savefig()  \n\n\n\n1.4.2.6 Relative paths\nIn this course, when reading and writing files, please keep all the files using relative paths. That is, only write the path starting from the working directory.\n\nExample 1.2 Consider the following tasks:\n\nYour working directory is C:/Users/Xinli/projects/.\nWant to read a file D:/Files/example.csv.\nWant to generate a file whose name is result.csv and put it in a subfoler named foldername.\n\nTo do the tasks, don’t directly run the code pd.read_csv('D:/Files/example.csv'). Instead you should first copy the file to your working directory C:/Users/Xinli/projects/, and then run the following code.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('example.csv')\ndf.to_csv('foldername/result.csv')\n\nPlease pay attention to how the paths are written.",

    "section": "1.5 Data visualization",
    "text": "1.5 Data visualization\nWe need to visualize the data during toying with models, especialy when we want to keep track of metrcis to evaluate the performance of our model. We will introduce two ways for the visualization.\n\n1.5.1 Naive way\nThe idea is to record the data we want to visualize, and then direct display the data with a certain visualization library. The most popular and default choice is matplotlib. Although there are many customizations, the basic usage is very simple.\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ny = [1, 0, 4, -1, 3]\nz = [-1, 0, 3, -2, 3]\n\nplt.plot(x, y, label='y')\nplt.plot(x, z, label='z')\nplt.legend()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince in most cases in this course we would like to see line plot, this piece of code shows the main usage.\n\nWe need to specify two series of data as x and y respectively.\nWe could show two lines in the same plot.\nIf we add labels, and show legend, legends and labels in the plot will be automatically generated.\n\n\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ny = [1, 0, 4, -1, 3]\nz = [-1, 0, 3, -2, 3]\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(x, y, label='y')\nax.plot(x, z, label='z')\nax.legend()\n\nax.set_xlabel('x')\nax.set_ylabel('y and z')\nax.set_title('Example')\n\nfig.set_size_inches((6, 4))\nfig.set_dpi(100)\nfig.savefig('example.png')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Tensorboard\n\n\nThis section is optional.\n\nInstead of manually recording data and show plots, we could use logging tools for visualization. Similar to libraries, there are many tools of choice. tensorboard is one of simpler tools. tensorboard originally is a tool for tensorflow. It later joins PyTorch and becomes a (relatively independent) tool. Here we will use it with PyTorch since in the second half of the semester we will talk about PyTorch. To install tensorboard after you install PyTorch you could use the following command. More details can be found here. Note that tensorboard depends on matplotlib therefore they have to be installed simutanously.\npip install matplotlib tensorboard\nThe basic idea of tensorboard is that it is logger that record the information you send to it. It can then retrieve the information and show some plots later. Whether the plots are good or not depends on how you structure the data sent to it. There are many customizations. Here we will only discuss one way to use it.\nThe mindset of using tensorboard is as follows. 1. A logger should be initialized to accept your data. 2. For organization, we put the logs in a foler structure. 3. During runs, we send data to the logger. 4. After the run, the logger is closed. 5. We could later run tensorboard to load these logs to see the data we generated during runs.\n\nfrom torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter\n\nwriter = SummaryWriter('runs/ex1')\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ny = [1, 0, 4, -1, 3]\nz = [-1, 0, 3, -2, 3]\n\nfor i in range(5):\n    writer.add_scalar('y', y[i], x[i])\n    writer.add_scalar('z', z[i], x[i])\n\nwriter.close()\n\nThis piece of code shows the basic usage of tensorboard.\n\nWe first initialize the logger and put it in the folder runs/ex1. Note that if this folder is not assigned, a folder with random name will be generated. But if the name is assigned like what we do here, the logs will be recorded in this folder everytime we run the code. This is NOT recommended.\nThen we use .add_scalar to send the data we need to the logger one by one. Note that for these scalar data the three arguments are label, value and independent variable.\nAt the end, the logger will be closed and saved to disk.\n\nTo visualize the result, you may type the command in comma line, and tensorboard will then let you know where you can visualize the data.\ntensorboard --logdir=runs/ex1 \nTensorBoard 2.18.0 at http://localhost:6006/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\nClick the link, you will see tensorboard as follows.\n\nHow tensorboard show the data depends on how you structure your data. Here I suggest a way to organize the data you send to tensorboard.\n\nUse date/time and other indicators as the name of each run.\nGroup similar metrics together and record them in a dictionary.\nWhen using a dictionary to send many scalars, use add_scalars instead of add_scalar.\n\n\nfrom torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nrunfolder = datetime.now().strftime('%Y%d%m-%H%M%S')\nwriter = SummaryWriter(f'runs/{runfolder}')\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ny = [1, 0, 4, -1, 3]\nz = [-1, 0, 3, -2, 3]\n\nfor i in range(5):\n    scalars = {\n        'y': y[i],\n        'z': z[i]\n    }\n    writer.add_scalars('scalars', scalars, x[i])\n\nwriter.close()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that the plots from tensorboard and matplotlib are a little different. The reason is that tensorboard automatically smooth the curve. You can use the cmoothing factor to control the effect. When you change it to be 0, you will get exactly the same plot.",

    "text": "2.1.1 Ideas\nAssume that we have a set of labeled data \\(\\{(X_i, y_i)\\}\\) where \\(y_i\\) denotes the label. Given a new data \\(X\\), how do we determine the label of it?\nk-NN algorithm starts from a very straightforward idea. We use the distances from the new data point \\(X\\) to the known data points to identify the label. If \\(X\\) is closer to \\(y_i\\) points, then we will label \\(X\\) as \\(y_i\\).\nLet us take cities and countries as an example. New York and Los Angeles are U.S cities, and Beijing and Shanghai are Chinese cities. Now we would like to consider Tianjin and Russellville. Do they belong to China or U.S? We calculate the distances from Tianjin (resp. Russellville) to all four known cities. Since Tianjin is closer to Beijing and Shanghai comparing to New York and Los Angeles, we classify Tianjin as a Chinese city. Similarly, since Russellville is closer to New York and Los Angeles comparing to Beijing and Shanghai, we classify it as a U.S. city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nG\n\n\n\nBeijing\n\nBeijing\n\n\n\nShanghai\n\nShanghai\n\n\n\nTianjin\n\nTianjin\n\n\n\nTianjin-&gt;Beijing\n\n\ncloser\n\n\n\nTianjin-&gt;Shanghai\n\n\ncloser   \n\n\n\nNew York\n\nNew York\n\n\n\nTianjin-&gt;New York\n\n\n far away\n\n\n\nLos Angelis\n\nLos Angelis\n\n\n\nTianjin-&gt;Los Angelis\n\n\n far away\n\n\n\nRussellville\n\nRussellville\n\n\n\nRussellville-&gt;Beijing\n\n\nfar away \n\n\n\nRussellville-&gt;Shanghai\n\n\nfar away\n\n\n\nRussellville-&gt;New York\n\n\ncloser  \n\n\n\nRussellville-&gt;Los Angelis\n\n\ncloser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis naive example explains the idea of k-NN. Here is a more detailed description of the algorithm.\n\n\n2.1.2 The Algorithm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotek-NN Classifier\n\n\n\nInputs: Given the training data set \\(\\{(X_i, y_i)\\}\\) where \\(X_i=(x_i^1,x_i^2,\\ldots,x_i^n)\\) represents \\(n\\) features and \\(y_i\\) represents labels. Given a new data point \\(\\tilde{X}=(\\tilde{x}^1,\\tilde{x}^2,\\ldots,\\tilde{x}^n)\\).\nOutputs: Want to find the best label for \\(\\tilde{X}\\).\n\nCompute the distance from \\(\\tilde{X}\\) to each \\(X_i\\).\nSort all these distances from the nearest to the furthest.\nFind the nearest \\(k\\) data points.\nDetermine the labels for each of these \\(k\\) nearest points, and compute the frenqucy of each labels.\nThe most frequent label is considered to be the label of \\(\\tilde{X}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Details\n\nThe distance between two data points are defined by the Euclidean distance:\n\n\\[\ndist\\left((x^j_i)_{j=1}^n, (\\tilde{x}^j)_{j=1}^n\\right)=\\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^n(x^j_i-\\tilde{x}^j)^2}.\n\\]\n\nUsing linear algebra notations:\n\n\\[\ndist(X_i,\\tilde{X})=\\sqrt{(X_i-\\tilde{X})\\cdot(X_i-\\tilde{X})}.\n\\]\n\nAll the distances are stored in a \\(1\\)-dim numpy array, and we will combine it together with another \\(1\\)-dim array that store the labels of each point.\n\n\n\n2.1.4 The codes\n\n\nThis part is optional.\n\n\nargsort\nunique\nargmax\n\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef classify_kNN(inX, X, y, k=5):\n    # compute the distance between each row of X and Xmat\n    Dmat = np.sqrt(((inX - X)**2).sum(axis=1))\n    # sort by distance\n    k = min(k, Dmat.shape[0])\n    argsorted = Dmat.argsort()[:k]\n    relatedy = y[argsorted]\n    # count the freq. of the first k labels\n    labelcounts = np.unique(relatedy, return_counts=True)\n    # find the label with the most counts\n    label = labelcounts[0][labelcounts[1].argmax()]\n    return label\n\n\n\n\n2.1.5 sklearn packages\nYou may also directly use the kNN function KNeighborsClassifier packaged in sklearn.neighbors. You may check the description of the function online from here.\nThere are many ways to modify the kNN algorithm. What we just mentioned is the simplest idea. It is correspondent to the argument weights='uniform', algorithm='brute and metric='euclidean'. However due to the implementation details, the results we got from sklearn are still a little bit different from the results produced by our naive codes.\n\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nclf = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=10, weights='uniform',\n                           algorithm='brute', metric='euclidean')\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_pred = clf.predict(X_test)\n\n\n\n2.1.6 Normalization\nDifferent features may have different scales. It might be unfair for those features that have small scales. Therefore usually it is better to rescale all the features to make them have similar scales. After examining all the data, we find the minimal value minVal and the range ranges for each column. The normalization formula is:\n\\[\nX_{norm} = \\frac{X_{original}-minVal}{ranges}.\n\\]\nWe could also convert the normalized number back to the original value by\n\\[\nX_{original} = X_{norm} \\times ranges + minVal.\n\\]\n\n\nThe sample codes are listed below. This part is optional.\n\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef encodeNorm(X, parameters=None):\n    # parameters contains minVals and ranges\n    if parameters is None:\n        minVals = np.min(X, axis=0)\n        maxVals = np.max(X, axis=0)\n        ranges = np.maximum(maxVals - minVals, np.ones(minVals.size))\n        parameters = {'ranges': ranges, 'minVals': minVals}\n    else:\n        minVals = parameters['minVals']\n        ranges = parameters['ranges']\n    Nmat = np.tile(minVals, (X.shape[0], 1))\n    Xnorm = (X - Nmat)/ranges\n    return (Xnorm, parameters)\n\n\ndef decodeNorm(X, parameters):\n    # parameters contains minVals and ranges\n    ranges = parameters['ranges']\n    minVals = parameters['minVals']\n    Nmat = np.tile(minVals, (X.shape[0], 1))\n    Xoriginal = X * ranges + Nmat\n    return Xoriginal\n\n\nYou could use MinMaxScaler from sklearn.preprocessing to achive the goal. The API is very similar to an estimator.\n\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n\nmm = MinMaxScaler()\nmm.fit(X)\nX_norm = mm.transform(X)\n\nThe last two lines can be combined into\n\nX_norm = mm.fit_transform(X)",

    "text": "2.2 k-NN Project 1: iris Classification\nThis data is from sklearn.datasets. This dataset consists of 3 different types of irises’ petal / sepal length / width, stored in a \\(150\\times4\\) numpy.ndarray. We already explored the dataset briefly in the previous chapter. This time we will try to use the feature provided to predict the type of the irises. For the purpose of plotting, we will only use the first two features: sepal length and sepal width.\n\n2.2.1 Explore the dataset\nWe first load the dataset.\n\nfrom sklearn import datasets\niris = datasets.load_iris()\nX = iris.data[:, :2]\ny = iris.target\n\nThen we would like to split the dataset into trainning data and test data. Here we are going to use sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split function. Besides the dataset, we should also provide the propotion of the test set comparing to the whole dataset. We will choose test_size=0.1 here, which means that the size of the test set is 0.1 times the size of the whole dataset. stratify=y means that when split the dataset we want to split respects the distribution of labels in y.\nThe split will be randomly. You may set the argument random_state to be a certain number to control the random process. If you set a random_state, the result of the random process will stay the same. This is for reproducible output across multiple function calls.\nAfter we get the training set, we should also normalize it. All our normalization should be based on the training set. When we want to use our model on some new data points, we will use the same normalization parameters to normalize the data points in interests right before we apply the model. Here since we mainly care about the test set, we could normalize the test set at this stage.\nNote that in the following code, we mainly use the implementation from sklearn.  \n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.1, random_state=1, stratify=y)\n\nmm = MinMaxScaler()\nX_train_norm = mm.fit_transform(X_train)\nX_test_norm = mm.transform(X_test)\n\nBefore we start to play with k-NN, let us look at the data first. Since we only choose two features, it is able to plot these data points on a 2D plane, with different colors representing different classes.\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Plot the scatter plot.\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(10,7))\nax = fig.add_subplot(111)\nscatter = ax.scatter(X_train[:, 0], X_train[:, 1], c=y_train)\n\n# Generate legends.\nlabels = ['setosa', 'versicolor', 'virginica']\n_ = fig.legend(handles=scatter.legend_elements()[0], labels=labels,\n               loc=\"right\", title=\"Labels\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Apply our k-NN model\nNow let us apply k-NN to this dataset. Since our data is prepared, what we need to do is directly call the functions.\n\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nn_neighbors = 10\nclf = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors, weights=\"uniform\", metric=\"euclidean\",\n                           algorithm='brute')\nclf.fit(X_train_norm, y_train)\ny_pred_sk = clf.predict(X_test_norm)\n\nacc = np.mean(y_pred_sk == y_test)\nacc\n\nnp.float64(0.7333333333333333)\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Using data pipeline\nWe may organize the above process in a neater way. After we get a data, the usual process is to apply several transforms to the data before we really get to the model part. Using terminolgies from sklearn, the former are called transforms, and the latter is called an estimator. In this example, we have exactly one tranform which is the normalization. The estimator here we use is the k-NN classifier.\nsklearn provides a standard way to write these codes, which is called pipeline. We may chain the transforms and estimators in a sequence and let the data go through the pipeline. In this example, the pipeline contains two steps: 1. The normalization transform sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler. 2. The k-NN classifier sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier. This is the same one as we use previously.\nThe code is as follows. It is a straightforward code. Note that the () after the class in each step of steps is very important. The codes cannot run if you miss it.\nAfter we setup the pipeline, we may use it as other estimators since it is an estimator. Here we may also use the accuracy function provided by sklearn to perform the computation. It is essentially the same as our acc computation.\n\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\nn_neighbors = 10\nsteps = [('scaler', MinMaxScaler()),\n         ('knn', KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors, weights=\"uniform\",\n                                      metric=\"euclidean\", algorithm='brute'))]\npipe = Pipeline(steps=steps)\npipe.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_pipe = pipe.predict(X_test)\naccuracy_score(y_pipe, y_test)\n\n0.7333333333333333\n\n\nOnce a pipeline is set, you may use step name with TWO underscores __ with parameter name to get access to a specific parameter. Please check the following code.\n\npipe.get_params()['knn__n_neighbors']\n\n10\n\n\n\npipe.set_params(knn__n_neighbors=5)\npipe.get_params()['knn__n_neighbors']\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Visualize the Decision boundary\n\n\nThis section is optional.\n\nUsing the classifier we get above, we are able to classify every points on the plane. This enables us to draw the following plot, which is called the Decision boundary. It helps us to visualize the relations between features and the classes.\nWe use DecisionBoundaryDisplay from sklearn.inspection to plot the decision boundary. The function requires us to have a fitted classifier. We may use the classifier pipe we got above. Note that this classifier should have some build-in structures that our classify_kNN function doesn’t have. We may rewrite our codes to make it work, but this goes out of the scope of this section. This is supposed to be Python programming exercise. We will talk about it in the future if we have enough time.\nWe first plot the dicision boundary using DecisionBoundaryDisplay.from_estimator. Then we plot the points from X_test. From the plot it is very clear which points are misclassified.\n\nfrom sklearn.inspection import DecisionBoundaryDisplay\n\ndisp = DecisionBoundaryDisplay.from_estimator(\n            pipe, \n            X_train,\n            response_method=\"predict\",\n            plot_method=\"pcolormesh\",\n            xlabel=iris.feature_names[0],\n            ylabel=iris.feature_names[1],\n            alpha=0.5)\ndisp.ax_.scatter(X_test[:, 0], X_test[:, 1], c=y_test, edgecolor=\"k\")\ndisp.figure_.set_size_inches((10,7))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.5 k-Fold Cross-Validation\nPreviously we perform a random split and test our model in this case. What would happen if we fit our model on another split? We might get a different accuracy score. So in order to evaluate the performance of our model, it is natual to consider several different split and compute the accuracy socre for each case, and combine all these socres together to generate an index to indicate whehter our model is good or bad. This naive idea is called k-Fold Cross-Validation.\nThe algorithm is described as follows. We first randomly split the dataset into k groups of the same size. We use one of them as the test set, and the rest together forming the training set, and use this setting to get an accuracy score. We did this for each group to be chosen as the test set. Then the final score is the mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKFold\n\n\n\n\n\nKFold from sklearn.model.selection is used to split the dataset into k groups and in each iteration to chooose one as the validation set.\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import KFold\n\nkf = KFold(n_splits=5)\n\nfor train_idx, val_idx in kf.split(range(10)):\n    print(train_idx, val_idx)\n\n[2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9] [0 1]\n[0 1 4 5 6 7 8 9] [2 3]\n[0 1 2 3 6 7 8 9] [4 5]\n[0 1 2 3 4 5 8 9] [6 7]\n[0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7] [8 9]\n\n\n\nI only put range(10) in kf.split since it only needs to work with the index. If a dataset is put there, the output is still the index of which data is in the training set and which is in the validation set.\nIf you want to randomize the selection, when set up KFold we could add an argument shuffle=True. In this case, we may use random_state to control the outcome provide reproducing ability.\n\nLet us see an example for our data.\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import KFold\nfrom sklearn.base import clone\n\nkf = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=1)\n\ncv_scores = []\nfor train_idx, val_idx in kf.split(X):\n    pipe_tmp = clone(pipe)\n    pipe_tmp.fit(X[train_idx], y[train_idx])\n    cv_scores.append(pipe_tmp.score(X[val_idx], y[val_idx]))\ncv_scores\n\n[0.8333333333333334, 0.7333333333333333, 0.7, 0.7, 0.8]\n\n\n\nnp.mean(cv_scores)\n\nnp.float64(0.7533333333333333)\n\n\nNote that here sklearn.base.clone is used to initialize an unfitted model which has the same hyperpamaters as pipe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotecross_validate\n\n\n\n\n\nKFold is too “manual”. We may use cross_validate to autmate the above process. Note that depending on the arguments given cross_validate may be implemented by KFold.\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_validate\n\ncv_result = cross_validate(pipe, X, y, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')\ncv_result\n\n{'fit_time': array([0.00099683, 0.001019  , 0.00201988, 0.00100589, 0.        ]),\n 'score_time': array([0.00699735, 0.00398231, 0.00698066, 0.00397944, 0.00500011]),\n 'test_score': array([0.73333333, 0.8       , 0.76666667, 0.9       , 0.73333333])}\n\n\nAnd you may only see the scores if this is the only thing that interests you.\n\ncv_result['test_score']\n\narray([0.73333333, 0.8       , 0.76666667, 0.9       , 0.73333333])\n\n\n\nYou may choose different scoring methods. More info can be found in the document.\nIf cv=5, KFold(5, shuffle=False) is applied here. If you prefer random split, you may directly use KFold here.\n\n\ncv_result = cross_validate(pipe, X, y, scoring='accuracy',\n                           cv=KFold(5, shuffle=True, random_state=1))\ncv_result['test_score']\n\narray([0.83333333, 0.73333333, 0.7       , 0.7       , 0.8       ])\n\n\nYou may compare this result with the previous one and the one in KFold section. Of course, the cv score is usually the mean of all the scores.\n\ncv_result['test_score'].mean()\n\nnp.float64(0.7533333333333333)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotecross_val_score\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a faster way to directly get cv_result['test_score'] in cross_validate section. The argument about cv and scoring are the same as cross_validate.\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\ncv_scores = cross_val_score(pipe, X, y, cv=KFold(5, shuffle=True, random_state=1))\ncv_scores\n\narray([0.83333333, 0.73333333, 0.7       , 0.7       , 0.8       ])\n\n\n\ncv_scores.mean()\n\nnp.float64(0.7533333333333333)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.6 Choosing a k value\nIn the previous example we choose k to be 10 as an example. To choose a k value we usually run some test by trying different k and choose the one with the best performance. In this case, best performance means the highest cross-validation score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteGrid search\n\n\n\n\n\nsklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV provides a way to do this directly. We only need to setup the esitimator, the metric (which is the cross-validation score in this case), and the hyperparameters to be searched through, and GridSearchCV will run the search automatically.\nWe let k go from 1 to 100. The code is as follows.\nNote that parameters is where we set the search space. It is a dictionary. The key is the name of the estimator plus double _ and then plus the name of the parameter.\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\nn_list = list(range(1, 101))\nparameters = dict(knn__n_neighbors=n_list)\nclf = GridSearchCV(pipe, parameters)\nclf.fit(X, y)\nclf.best_estimator_.get_params()[\"knn__n_neighbors\"]\n\n35\n\n\nAfter we fit the data, the best_estimator_.get_params() can be printed. It tells us that it is best to use 31 neibhours for our model. We can directly use the best estimator by calling clf.best_estimator_.\n\ncv_scores = cross_val_score(clf.best_estimator_, X, y, cv=5)\nnp.mean(cv_scores)\n\nnp.float64(0.82)\n\n\nThe cross-validation score using k=31 is calculated. This serves as a benchmark score and we may come back to dataset using other methods and compare the scores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotePlot the curve\n\n\n\n\n\nGrid search can only give us a single number that has the best cross validation score. However there are many cases that the number might not be really the best. So usually we also want to see the result for all k. The best way to display all results simutanously is to plot the curve.\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nn_list = list(range(1, 101))\ncv_scores = []\nfor k in n_list:\n    pipe_tmp = clone(pipe)\n    pipe_tmp.set_params(knn__n_neighbors=k)\n    cv_scores.append(cross_val_score(pipe_tmp, X, y, cv=5).mean())\n\nplt.plot(cv_scores)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this plot, combining with the best cv score happens at k=31, we could make our final decision about which k to choose.",

    "text": "3.1.1 Motivation and Definition\nAssume that we have a dataset of totally \\(n\\) objects, and these objects are divided into \\(k\\) classes. The \\(i\\)-th class has \\(n_i\\) objects. Then if we randomly pick an object, the probability to get an object belonging to the \\(i\\)-th class is\n\\[\np_i=\\frac{n_i}{n}\n\\]\nIf we then guess the class of the object purely based on the distribution of each class, the probability that our guess is incorrect is\n\\[\n1-p_i = 1-\\frac{n_i}{n}.\n\\]\nTherefore, if we randomly pick an object that belongs to the \\(i\\)-th class and randomly guess its class purely based on the distribution but our guess is wrong, the probability that such a thing happens is\n\\[\np_i(1-p_i).\n\\]\nConsider all classes. The probability at which any object of the dataset will be mislabelled when it is randomly labeled is the sum of the probability described above:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^kp_i(1-p_i)=\\sum_{i=1}^kp_i-\\sum_{i=1}^kp_i^2=1-\\sum_{i=1}^kp_i^2.\n\\]\nThis is the definition formula for the Gini impurity.\n\nDefinition 3.1 The Gini impurity is calculated using the following formula\n\\[\nGini = \\sum_{i=1}^kp_i(1-p_i)=\\sum_{i=1}^kp_i-\\sum_{i=1}^kp_i^2=1-\\sum_{i=1}^kp_i^2,\n\\] where \\(p_i\\) is the probability of class \\(i\\).\n\nThe way to understand Gini impurity is to consider some extreme examples.\n\nExample 3.1 Assume that we only have one class. Therefore \\(k=1\\), and \\(p_1=1\\). Then the Gini impurity is\n\\[\nGini = 1-1^2=0.\n\\] This is the minimum possible Gini impurity. It means that the dataset is pure: all the objects contained are of one unique class. In this case, we won’t make any mistakes if we randomly guess the label.\n\n\nExample 3.2 Assume that we have two classes. Therefore \\(k=2\\). Consider the distribution \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\). We know that \\(p_1+p_2=1\\). Therefore \\(p_2=1-p_1\\). Then the Gini impurity is\n\\[\nGini(p_1) = 1-p_1^2-p_2^2=1-p_1^2-(1-p_1)^2=2p_1-2p_1^2.\n\\] When \\(0\\leq p_1\\leq 1\\), this function \\(Gini(p_1)\\) is between \\(0\\) and \\(0.5\\). - It gets \\(0\\) when \\(p_1=0\\) or \\(1\\). In these two cases, the dataset is still a one-class set since the size of one class is \\(0\\). - It gets \\(0.5\\) when \\(p_1=0.5\\). This means that the Gini impurity is maximized when the size of different classes are balanced.\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Algorithm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAlgorithm: Gini impurity\n\n\n\nInputs A dataset \\(S=\\{data=[features, label]\\}\\) with labels.\nOutputs The Gini impurity of the dataset.\n\nGet the size \\(n\\) of the dataset.\nGo through the label list, and find all unique labels: \\(uniqueLabelList\\).\nGo through each label \\(l\\) in \\(uniqueLabelList\\) and count how many elements belonging to the label, and record them as \\(n_l\\).\nUse the formula to compute the Gini impurity:\n\\[\nGini = 1-\\sum_{l\\in uniqueLabelList}\\left(\\frac{n_l}{n}\\right)^2.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sample manual codes are optional.\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndef gini(S):\n    N = len(S)\n    y = S[:, -1].reshape(N)\n    gini = 1 - ((pd.Series(y).value_counts()/N)**2).sum()\n    return gini",

If we are alllowed to keep splitting it, it is possible to get to a case that each end node is pure: the Gini impurity is 0. This means two things:\n\nThe tree learns too many (unnecessary) detailed info from the training set which might not be applied to the test set. This is called overfitting. We should prevent a model from overfitting.\nWe could use the number of split to indicate the progress of the learning.\n\nIn other words, the finer the splits are, the further the learning is. We need to consider some early stop conditions to prevent the model from overfitting.\nSome possible early stop conditions:\n\nmax_depth: The max depth of the tree. The default is none which means no limits.\nmin_samples_split: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. The default is 2 which means that we will split a node with as few as 2 elements if needed.\nmin_samples_leaf: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. The default is 1 which means that we will still split the node even if one subset only contains 1 element.\n\nIf we don’t set them (which means that we use the default setting), the dataset will be split untill all subsets are pure.\n\nExample 3.3 (ALMOST all end nodes are pure) In this example, we let the tree grow as further as possible. It only stops when (almost) all end nodes are pure, even if the end nodes only contain ONE element (like #6 and #11).\n\nclf = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=40)\nclf.fit(X, y)\nplt.figure(figsize=(3, 3), dpi=200)\nplot_tree(clf, filled=True, impurity=True, node_ids=True)\n\n[Text(0.5, 0.9166666666666666, 'node #0\\nx[1] &lt;= 0.8\\ngini = 0.667\\nsamples = 150\\nvalue = [50, 50, 50]'),\n Text(0.4090909090909091, 0.75, 'node #1\\ngini = 0.0\\nsamples = 50\\nvalue = [50, 0, 0]'),\n Text(0.4545454545454546, 0.8333333333333333, 'True  '),\n Text(0.5909090909090909, 0.75, 'node #2\\nx[1] &lt;= 1.75\\ngini = 0.5\\nsamples = 100\\nvalue = [0, 50, 50]'),\n Text(0.5454545454545454, 0.8333333333333333, '  False'),\n Text(0.36363636363636365, 0.5833333333333334, 'node #3\\nx[0] &lt;= 4.95\\ngini = 0.168\\nsamples = 54\\nvalue = [0, 49, 5]'),\n Text(0.18181818181818182, 0.4166666666666667, 'node #4\\nx[1] &lt;= 1.65\\ngini = 0.041\\nsamples = 48\\nvalue = [0, 47, 1]'),\n Text(0.09090909090909091, 0.25, 'node #5\\ngini = 0.0\\nsamples = 47\\nvalue = [0, 47, 0]'),\n Text(0.2727272727272727, 0.25, 'node #6\\ngini = 0.0\\nsamples = 1\\nvalue = [0, 0, 1]'),\n Text(0.5454545454545454, 0.4166666666666667, 'node #7\\nx[1] &lt;= 1.55\\ngini = 0.444\\nsamples = 6\\nvalue = [0, 2, 4]'),\n Text(0.45454545454545453, 0.25, 'node #8\\ngini = 0.0\\nsamples = 3\\nvalue = [0, 0, 3]'),\n Text(0.6363636363636364, 0.25, 'node #9\\nx[0] &lt;= 5.45\\ngini = 0.444\\nsamples = 3\\nvalue = [0, 2, 1]'),\n Text(0.5454545454545454, 0.08333333333333333, 'node #10\\ngini = 0.0\\nsamples = 2\\nvalue = [0, 2, 0]'),\n Text(0.7272727272727273, 0.08333333333333333, 'node #11\\ngini = 0.0\\nsamples = 1\\nvalue = [0, 0, 1]'),\n Text(0.8181818181818182, 0.5833333333333334, 'node #12\\nx[0] &lt;= 4.85\\ngini = 0.043\\nsamples = 46\\nvalue = [0, 1, 45]'),\n Text(0.7272727272727273, 0.4166666666666667, 'node #13\\ngini = 0.444\\nsamples = 3\\nvalue = [0, 1, 2]'),\n Text(0.9090909090909091, 0.4166666666666667, 'node #14\\ngini = 0.0\\nsamples = 43\\nvalue = [0, 0, 43]')]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example there is one exception. #13 node is not pure.

They cannot be split further purely based on features.\n\nTherefore we could treat these hyperparameters as an indicator about how far the dataset is split. The further the dataset is split, the further the learning goes, the more details are learned. Since we don’t want the model to be overfitting, we don’t want to split the dataset that far. In this case, we could use the learning curve to help us make the decision.\nIn this example, let us choose min_samples_leaf as the indicator. When min_samples_leaf is big, the learning just starts. When min_samples_leaf=1, we reach the far most side of learning. We will see how the training and testing accuracy changes along the learning process.\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.15, random_state=42)\nnum_leaf = list(range(1, 100))\ntrain_acc = []\ntest_acc = []\nfor i in num_leaf:\n    clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42, min_samples_leaf=i)\n    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n    train_acc.append(clf.score(X_train, y_train))\n    test_acc.append(clf.score(X_test, y_test))\nplt.plot(num_leaf, train_acc, label='training')\nplt.plot(num_leaf, test_acc, label='testing')\nplt.gca().set_xlim((max(num_leaf)+1, min(num_leaf)-1))\nplt.legend()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this plot, the accuracy has a big jump at min_sample_leaf=41. So we could choose this to be our hyperparameter.\n\n\n3.3.4 Apply CART manually (optional)\n\n\nThe manual sample code is optional.\n\nWe apply split to the dataset S.\n\nfrom assests.codes.dt import gini, split, countlabels\nr = split(S)\nif r['split'] is True:\n    Gl, Gr = r['sets']\n    print(r['pair'])\n    print('The left subset\\'s Gini impurity is {g:.2f},'.format(g=gini(Gl)),\n          ' and its label counts is {d:}'.format(d=countlabels(Gl)))\n    print('The right subset\\'s Gini impurity is {g:.2f},'.format(g=gini(Gr)),\n          ' and its label counts is {d}'.format(d=countlabels(Gr)))\n\n(0, np.float64(1.9))\nThe left subset's Gini impurity is 0.00,  and its label counts is {0.0: np.int64(50)}\nThe right subset's Gini impurity is 0.50,  and its label counts is {1.0: np.int64(50), 2.0: np.int64(50)}\n\n\nThe results shows that S is splitted into two subsets based on the 0-th feature and the split value is 1.9.\nThe left subset is already pure since its Gini impurity is 0. All elements in the left subset is label 0 (which is setosa). The right one is mixed since its Gini impurity is 0.5. Therefore we need to apply split again to the right subset.\n\nr = split(Gr)\nif r['split'] is True:\n    Grl, Grr = r['sets']\n    print(r['pair'])\n    print('The left subset\\'s Gini impurity is {g:.2f},'.format(g=gini(Grl)),\n          ' and its label counts is {d:}'.format(d=countlabels(Grl)))\n    print('The right subset\\'s Gini impurity is {g:.2f},'.format(g=gini(Grr)),\n          ' and its label counts is {d}'.format(d=countlabels(Grr)))\n\n(1, np.float64(1.7))\nThe left subset's Gini impurity is 0.17,  and its label counts is {1.0: np.int64(49), 2.0: np.int64(5)}\nThe right subset's Gini impurity is 0.04,  and its label counts is {2.0: np.int64(45), 1.0: np.int64(1)}\n\n\nThis time the subset is splitted into two more subsets based on the 1-st feature and the split value is 1.7. The total Gini impurity is minimized using this split.\nThe decision we created so far can be described as follows:\n\nCheck the first feature sepal length (cm) to see whether it is smaller or equal to 1.9.\n\nIf it is, classify it as lable 0 which is setosa.\nIf not, continue to the next stage.\n\nCheck the second feature sepal width (cm) to see whether it is smaller or equal to 1.7.\n\nIf it is, classify it as label 1 which is versicolor.\nIf not, classify it as label 2 which is virginica.\n\n\n\n3.3.4.1 Analyze the differences between the two methods\nThe tree generated by sklearn and the tree we got manually is a little bit different. Let us explore the differences here.\nTo make it easier to split the set, we could convert the numpy.ndarray to pandas.DataFrame.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(X)\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.4\n0.2\n\n\n1\n1.4\n0.2\n\n\n2\n1.3\n0.2\n\n\n3\n1.5\n0.2\n\n\n4\n1.4\n0.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow based on our tree, we would like to get all data points that the first feature (which is marked as 0) is smaller or equal to 1.9. We save it as df1. Similarly based on the tree gotten from sklearn, we would like to get all data points taht the second feature (which is marked as 1) is smaller or equal to 0.8 and save it to df2.\n\ndf1 = df[df[0]&lt;=1.9]\ndf2 = df[df[1]&lt;=0.8]\n\nThen we would like to compare these two dataframes. What we want is to see whether they are the same regardless the order. One way to do this is to sort the two dataframes and then compare them directly.\nTo sort the dataframe we use the method DataFrame.sort_values. The details can be found here. Note that after sort_values we apply reset_index to reset the index just in case the index is massed by the sort operation.\nThen we use DataFrame.equals to check whether they are the same.\n\ndf1sorted = df1.sort_values(by=df1.columns.tolist()).reset_index(drop=True)\ndf2sorted = df2.sort_values(by=df2.columns.tolist()).reset_index(drop=True)\nprint(df1sorted.equals(df2sorted))\n\nTrue\n\n\nSo these two sets are really the same. The reason this happens can be seen from the following two graphs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom our code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom sklearn\n\n\n\n\n\nSo you can see that either way can give us the same classification. This means that given one dataset the construction of the decision tree might be random at some points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotenote-random_state\n\n\n\nSince the split is random, when using sklearn.DecisionTreeClassifier to construct decision trees, sometimes we might get the same tree as what we get from our naive codes.\nTo illustrate this phenomenaon I need to set the random state in case it will generate the same tree as ours when I need it to generate a different tree. The parameter random_state=40 mentioned before is for this purpose.\n\n\nAnother difference is the split value of the second branch. In our case it is 1.7 and in sklearn case it is 1.75. So after we get the right subset from the first split (which is called dfr), we would split it into two sets based on whether the second feature is above or below 1.7.\n\ndfr = df[df[0]&gt;1.9]\ndf2a = dfr[dfr[1]&gt;1.7]\ndf2b = dfr[dfr[1]&lt;=1.7]\nprint(df2b[1].max())\nprint(df2a[1].min())\n\n1.7\n1.8\n\n\nNow you can see where the split number comes from. In our code, when we found a split, we will directly use that number as the cut. In this case it is 1.7.\nIn sklearn, when it finds a split, the algorithm will go for the middle of the gap as the cut. In this case it is (1.7+1.8)/2=1.75.",

    "text": "4.1.1 Basic bagging\nOne approach to get many estimators is to use the same training algorithm for every predictor and train them on different random subsets of the training set. When sampling is performed with replacement, this method is called bagging (short for bootstrap aggregating). When sampling is performed without replacement, it is called pasting.\nConsider the following example. The dataset is the one we used in Chpater 3: make_moon. We split the dataset into training and test sets.\n\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_moons\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nX, y = make_moons(n_samples=10000, noise=0.4, random_state=42)\nplt.scatter(x=X[:, 0], y=X[:, 1], c=y)\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would like to sample from the dataset to get some smaller minisets. We will use sklearn.model_selection.ShuffleSplit to perform the action.\nThe output of ShuffleSplit is a generator. To get the index out of it we need a for loop. You may check out the following code.\nNote that ShuffleSplit is originally used to shuffle data into training and test sets. We would only use the shuffle function out of it, so we will set test_size to be 1 and use _ later in the for loop since we won’t use that part of the information.\nWhat we finally get is a generator rs that produces indexes of subsets of X_train and y_train.\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import ShuffleSplit\nn_trees = 1000\nn_instances = 100\nrs = ShuffleSplit(n_splits=n_trees, test_size=1, train_size=n_instances).split(X_train)\n\nsklearn provides BaggingClassifier to directly perform bagging or pasting. The code is as follows.\n\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\n\nbag_clf = BaggingClassifier(DecisionTreeClassifier(),\n                            n_estimators=1000,\n                            max_samples=1.0,\n                            bootstrap=True)\n\nIn the above code, bag_clf is a bagging classifier, made of 500 DecisionTreeClassifers, and is trained over subsets of size 1.0. The option bootstrap=True means that it is bagging. If you would like to use pasting, the option is bootstrap=False.\nThis bag_clf also has .fit() and .predict() methods. It is used the same as our previous classifiers. Let us try the make_moon dataset.\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\nbag_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_pred_bag = bag_clf.predict(X_test)\naccuracy_score(y_pred_bag, y_test)\n\n0.838\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 max_samples\nThe original bagging algoithm requires the “subset” has the same number of datapoints as the original set. Since duplicates are allowed, we are expected to use 63% of the data from the original dataset.\n\n\nClick to expand for more details.\n\nLet the original dataset have \\(N\\) elements. The probability to pick any specific data is \\(1/N\\), and therefore the probability not to pick it is \\(1-1/N\\). If we pick \\(N\\) elements with replacement, the probability that we never pick a specific element is \\[\n(1-\\frac1N)^N\\rightarrow \\mathrm e^{-1},\\quad \\text{when }N\\rightarrow\\infty.\n\\] Therefore when \\(N\\) is large, the probability for each element not to be picked is approximately \\(\\mathrm e^{-1}\\), and then the probability for it to be picked is approximately \\(1-\\mathrm e^{-1}\\).\nLet \\(I_i\\) be the random variable representing whether the element \\(i\\) is picked or not. So \\[\nI_i=\\begin{cases}1&i \\text{ is picked}\\\\\n0&i\\text{ is not picked}\\end{cases}.\n\\] So \\[\nP(I_i=1)=1-\\mathrm e^{-1},\\quad P(I_i=0)=\\mathrm e^{-1},\\quad \\text{ and }E[I_i]=1\\cdot(1-\\mathrm e^{-1})+0\\cdot(\\mathrm e^{-1})=1-\\mathrm e^{-1}.\n\\] The expectation of the final sample size proportion is \\[\nE[\\frac1N\\sum_{i=1}^NI_i]=\\frac1N\\sum_{i=1}^IE[I_i]=1-\\mathrm e^{-1}\\approx 0.63.\n\\]\nWith similar calculation, if we pick \\(\\alpha N\\) data, the expectation of the final sample size proportion is \\(1-\\mathrm e^{-\\alpha}\\).\n\n\nIn sklearn, the requiremnt is relaxed, that you may have any number of data in each sample. This gives more flexiblity to adjust your model, that the sample size may affect the performance of the model. It is set by the argument max_samples.\n\nIf it is float that between 0 and 1, it will be used as the proportion. The default value is \\(1.0\\) which means that we use the original size as the sample size.\nIF it is an integer that is bigger than \\(1\\), it will be used as the fixed sample size, no matter what the orginal data size is.\n\n\n\n4.1.3 OOB score\nWhen we use bagging, it is possible that some of the training data are not used. In this case, we could record which data are not used, and just use them as the test set, instead of providing extra data for test. The data that are not used is called out-of-bag instances, or oob for short. The accuracy over the oob data is called the oob score.\nWe could set oob_score=True to enable the function when creating a BaggingClassifier, and use .oob_score_ to get the oob score after training.\n\nbag_clf_oob = BaggingClassifier(DecisionTreeClassifier(),\n                                n_estimators=1000,\n                                bootstrap=True,\n                                oob_score=True)\nbag_clf_oob.fit(X_train, y_train)\nbag_clf_oob.oob_score_\n\n0.8408235294117647\n\n\n\n\n4.1.4 Random Forests\nWhen the classifiers used in a bagging classifier are all Decision Trees, the bagging classifier is called a random forest. sklearn provide RandomForestClassifier class. It is almost the same as BaggingClassifier + DecisionTreeClassifer.\n\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n\nrnd_clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=1000, random_state=1)\nrnd_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\nrnd_clf.score(X_test, y_test)\n\n0.8453333333333334\n\n\nWhen we use the Decision Tree as our base estimators, the class RandomForestClassifier provides more control over growing the random forest, with a certain optimizations. If you would like to use other estimators, then BaggingClassifier should be used.\n\n\n4.1.5 Extra-trees\nWhen growing a Decision Tree, our method is to search through all possible ways to find the best split point that get the lowest Gini impurity. Anohter method is to use a random split. Of course a random tree performs much worse, but if we use it to form a random forest, the voting system can help to increase the accuracy. On the other hand, random split is much faster than a regular Decision Tree.\nThis type of forest is called Extremely Randomized Trees, or Extra-Trees for short. We could modify the above random forest classifier code to implement the extra-tree algorithm. The key point is that we don’t apply the Decision Tree algorithm. Instead we perform a random split: select a random feature, and split at a random value. In sklearn there is an ExtraTreesClassifier to create such a classifier.\nNote that for Extra-Tree, we use the whole dataset instead of samples, because the random split already ensures diversity so we need to reduce variance from resampling. So technically Extra-Tree is not a Bagging method in the standard way, although it looks like one.\n\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesClassifier\n\next_clf = ExtraTreesClassifier(n_estimators=1000, random_state=1)\next_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\next_clf.score(X_test, y_test)\n\n0.8413333333333334\n\n\nIn the above example, RandomForestClassifier and ExtraTreesClassifier get similar accuracy. However from the code below, you will see that in this example ExtraTreesClassifier is much faster than RandomForestClassifier.\n\nfrom time import time\n\nt0 = time()\nrnd_clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=1000, random_state=1)\nrnd_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\nt1 = time()\nprint(\"Random Frorest: {}\".format(t1 - t0))\n\nt0 = time()\next_clf = ExtraTreesClassifier(n_estimators=1000, random_state=1)\next_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\nt1 = time()\nprint(\"Extremely Randomized Trees: {}\".format(t1 - t0))\n\nRandom Frorest: 9.842219591140747\nExtremely Randomized Trees: 5.346597909927368\n\n\n\n\n4.1.6 Gini importance\nAfter training a Decision Tree, we could look at each node. Each split is against a feature, which decrease the Gini impurity the most. In other words, we could say that the feature is the most important during the split.\nUsing the average Gini impurity decreased as a metric, we could measure the importance of each feature. This is called Gini importance. If the feature is useful, it tends to split mixed labeled nodes into pure single class nodes.\nIn the case of random forest, since there are many trees, we might compute the weighted average of the Gini importance across all trees. The weight depends on how many times the feature is used in a specific node.\nUsing RandomForestClassifier, we can directly get access to the Gini importance of each feature by .feature_importance_. Please see the following example.\n\nrnd_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\nrnd_clf.feature_importances_\n\narray([0.45899576, 0.54100424])\n\n\nIn this example, you may see that the two features are relavely equally important, where the second feature is slightly more important since on average it decrease the Gini impurity a little bit more.",

    "text": "4.2 Voting machine\n\n4.2.1 Voting classifier\nAssume that we have several trained classifiers. The easiest way to make a better classifer out of what we already have is to build a voting system. That is, each classifier give its own prediction, and it will be considered as a vote, and finally the highest vote will be the prediction of the system.\nIn sklearn, you may use VotingClassifier. It works as follows.\n\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\n\nclfs = [('knn', KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)),\n        ('dt', DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=2))]\nvoting_clf = VotingClassifier(estimators=clfs, voting='hard')\n\nAll classifiers are stored in the list clfs, whose elements are tuples. The syntax is very similar to Pipeline. What the classifier does is to train all listed classifiers and use the majority vote to predict the class of given test data. If each classifier has one vote, the voting method is hard. There is also a soft voting method. In this case, every classifiers not only can predict the classes of the given data, but also estimiate the probability of the given data that belongs to certain classes. On coding level, each classifier should have the predict_proba() method. In this case, the weight of each vote is determined by the probability computed. In our course we mainly use hard voting.\nLet us use make_moon as an example. We first load the dataset.\n\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_moons\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nX, y = make_moons(n_samples=10000, noise=0.4, random_state=42)\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.15)\n\nWe would like to apply kNN model. As before, we build a data pipeline pipe to first apply MinMaxScaler and then KNeighborsClassifier.\n\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n\npipe = Pipeline(steps=[('scalar', MinMaxScaler()),\n                       ('knn', KNeighborsClassifier())])\nparameters = {'knn__n_neighbors': list(range(1, 51))}\ngs_knn = GridSearchCV(pipe, param_grid=parameters) \ngs_knn.fit(X_train, y_train)\nclf_knn = gs_knn.best_estimator_\nclf_knn.score(X_test, y_test)\n\n0.85\n\n\nThe resulted accuracy is shown above.\nWe then try it with the Decision Tree.\n\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\n\ngs_dt = GridSearchCV(DecisionTreeClassifier(), param_grid={'max_depth': list(range(1, 11)), 'max_leaf_nodes': list(range(10, 30))})\ngs_dt.fit(X_train, y_train)\nclf_dt = gs_dt.best_estimator_\nclf_dt.score(X_test, y_test)\n\n0.848\n\n\nWe would also want to try Logistic regression method. This will be covered in the next Chapter. At current stage we just use the default setting without changing any hyperparameters.\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nclf_lr = LogisticRegression()\nclf_lr.fit(X_train, y_train)\nclf_lr.score(X_test, y_test)\n\n0.8213333333333334\n\n\nNow we use a voting classifier to combine the results.\n\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nclfs = [('knn', KNeighborsClassifier()),\n        ('dt', DecisionTreeClassifier()),\n        ('lr', LogisticRegression())]\nvoting_clf = VotingClassifier(estimators=clfs, voting='hard')\nvoting_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\nvoting_clf.score(X_test, y_test)\n\n0.828\n\n\nYou may compare the results of all these four classifiers. The voting classifier is not guaranteed to be better. It is just a way to form a model.",

    "section": "4.3 AdaBoost",
    "text": "4.3 AdaBoost\nThis is the first algorithm that successfully implements the boosting idea. AdaBoost is short for Adaptive Boosting.\n\n4.3.1 Weighted dataset\nWe firstly talk about training a Decision Tree on a weighted dataset. The idea is very simple. When building a Decision Tree, we use some method to determine the split. In this course the Gini impurity is used. There are at least two other methods: cross-entropy and misclassified rate. For all three, the count of the elemnts in some classes is the essnetial part. To train the model over the weighted dataset, we just need to upgrade the count of the elements by the weighted count.\n\nExample 4.1 Consider the following data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx0\nx1\ny\nWeight\n\n\n\n\n1.0\n2.1\n+\n0.5\n\n\n1.0\n1.1\n+\n0.125\n\n\n1.3\n1.0\n-\n0.125\n\n\n1.0\n1.0\n-\n0.125\n\n\n2.0\n1.0\n+\n0.125\n\n\n\n\n\nThe weighted Gini impurity is\n\\[\n\\text{WeightedGini}=1-(0.5+0.125+0.125)^2-(0.125+0.125)^2=0.375.\n\\]\nYou may see that the original Gini impurity is just the weighted Gini impurity with equal weights. Therefore the first tree we get from AdaBoost (see below) is the same tree we get from the Decision Tree model in Chpater 3.\n\n\n\n4.3.2 General process\nHere is the rough description of AdaBoost.\n\nAssign weights to each data point. At the begining we could assign weights equally.\nTrain a classifier based on the weighted dataset, and use it to predict on the training set. Find out all wrong answers.\nAdjust the weights, by inceasing the weights of data points that are done wrongly in the previous generation.\nTrain a new classifier using the new weighted dataset. Predict on the training set and record the wrong answers.\nRepeat the above process to get many classifiers. The training stops either by hitting \\(0\\) error rate, or after a specific number of rounds.\nThe final results is based on the weighted total votes from all classifiers we trained.\n\nNow let us talk about the details. Assume there are \\(N\\) data points. Then the inital weights are set to be \\(\\dfrac1N\\). There are 2 sets of weights. Let \\(w^{(i)}\\) be weights of the \\(i\\)th data points. Let \\(\\alpha_j\\) be the weights of the \\(j\\)th classifier. After training the \\(j\\)th classifier, the error rate is denoted by \\(e_j\\). Then we have\n\\[\ne_j=\\frac{\\text{the total weights of data points that are misclassified by the $j$th classifier}}{\\text{the total weights of data points}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha_j=\\eta\\ln\\left(\\dfrac{1-e_j}{e_j}\\right).\n\\]\n\\[\nw^{(i)}_{\\text{new}}\\leftarrow\\text{normalization} \\leftarrow w^{(i)}\\leftarrow\\begin{cases}w^{(i)}&\\text{if the $i$th data is correctly classified,}\\\\w^{(i)}\\exp(\\alpha_j)&\\text{if the $i$th data is misclassified.}\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe first tree is the same tree we get from the regular Decision Tree model. In the rest of the training process, more weights are put on the data that we are wrong in the previous iteration. Therefore the process is the mimic of “learning from mistakes”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe \\(\\eta\\) in computing \\(\\alpha_j\\) is called the learning rate. It is a hyperparameter that will be specified mannually. It does exactly what it appears to do: alter the weights of each classifier. The default is 1.0. When the number is very small (which is recommended although it can be any positive number), more iterations will be expected.\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Example 1: the iris dataset\nSimilar to all previous models, sklearn provides AdaBoostClassifier. The way to use it is similar to previous models. Note that although we are able to use any classifiers for AdaBoost, the most popular choice is Decision Tree with max_depth=1. This type of Decision Trees are also called Decision Stumps.\nIn the following examples, we initialize an AdaBoostClassifier with 500 Decision Stumps and learning_rate=0.5.\n\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier\n\nada_clf = AdaBoostClassifier(DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1), n_estimators=1000,\n                             learning_rate=.5)\n\nWe will use the iris dataset for illustration. The cross_val_score is calculated as follows.\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\n\nX, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)\nscores = cross_val_score(ada_clf, X, y, cv=5)\nscores.mean()\n\nnp.float64(0.9466666666666667)\n\n\n\n\n4.3.4 Example 2: the Horse Colic dataset\nThis dataset is from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data is about whether horses survive if they get a disease called Colic. The dataset is preprocessed, and the result can be downloaded here. Note that based on the description, we only use the first 23 columns, and we change the original 3 outcomes (lived, died was euthanized) into 2 outcomes (lived, died) by combining outcome 2 and 3.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nfilepath = \"assests/datasets/horse_colic_clean.csv\"\ndf = pd.read_csv(filepath)\nX = df.iloc[:, :22].to_numpy().astype(float)\ny = (df.iloc[:, 22]&lt;2).to_numpy().astype(int)\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.15)\n\n\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n\nRANDOMSTATE = 1 \nada = AdaBoostClassifier(\n    estimator=DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1, random_state=RANDOMSTATE),\n    random_state=RANDOMSTATE\n)\n\n# Hyperparameter grid\nparam_grid = {\n    \"n_estimators\": [50, 100, 200],\n    \"learning_rate\": [0.01, 0.1, 1.0],\n    \"estimator__max_depth\": [1, 2, 3]\n}\n\n# Grid search with cross-validation\ngrid = GridSearchCV(\n    estimator=ada,\n    param_grid=param_grid,\n    cv=5,\n    scoring=\"accuracy\"\n)\n\n\ngrid.fit(X_train, y_train)\ngrid.best_estimator_.score(X_test, y_test)\n\n0.7678571428571429\n\n\n\ngrid.best_params_\n\n{'estimator__max_depth': 1, 'learning_rate': 1.0, 'n_estimators': 100}",

Since we already know that the function we are looking for has a formula \\(y=b+wx\\), we could use the pair \\((b, w)\\) to denote different candidates of our answer. For example, the following plot show some possibilities in green dashed lines, while each possiblity is denoted by \\((b, w)\\). Then the problem is reworded as to find the best pair \\((b, w)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Loss function\nThe “best” is defined in the following way. The dataset is given \\(\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}\\). If we choose a pair of parameters \\((b,w)\\), we will have an estimated regression line, as well as a set of estimated \\(\\hat{y_i}\\). The idea is to let the difference between \\(y_i\\) and \\(\\hat{y_i}\\) is as small as possible. In other words, a loss function \\(J\\) is defined as follows:\n\\[\nJ_{\\{(x_i,y_i)\\}}(b,w)=\\frac1N\\sum_{i=1}^N(y_i-\\hat{y_i})^2=\\frac1N\\sum_{i=1}^N(y_i-b-wx_i)^2\n\\tag{5.1}\\] and we are expected to find the \\((b,w)\\) such that the loss function is minimized. The contour map of \\(J\\) is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Gradient Descent\nWe use a technique called “gradient descent” to find the global minimal of \\(J\\). We start from a random point. For example \\((1.0, 1.5)\\). Then we find a direction where the cost \\(J\\) reduces the most, and move in that direction. This direction is computed by the gradient of the cost \\(J\\), and this is the reason why the algorithm is called “gradient descent”. After we get to a new point, we evaluate the new gradient and move in the new direction. The process is repeated and we are expected to get close to the minimal point after several iterations. Just like shown in the following plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parameter updating rule is shown below. The \\(\\eta\\) is called the learning rate. It is a hyperparameter that is used to control the learning process.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\pdv{J}{b}=\\frac1N\\sum_{i=1}^N2(y_i-b-wx_i)(-1),\\quad &b_{new} = b_{old}-\\eta*\\pdv{J}{b},\\\\\n&\\pdv{J}{w}=\\frac1N\\sum_{i=1}^N2(y_i-b-wx_i)(-x_i),\\quad &w_{new} = w_{old}-\\eta*\\pdv{J}{w},\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{5.2}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteLearning rate \\(\\eta\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally speaking, larger \\(\\eta\\) will move faster to the global minimal, but might be jumpy which cause it harder to converge. On the other side, smaller \\(\\eta\\) moves in a more stable fashion, but may take a long time to converge. See the following examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the first example, \\(\\eta\\) is too small, that after 200 iterations it is not very close to the minimal. In the second example, \\(\\eta\\) becomes large. Although it gets to somewhere near the minimal, the path is very jumpy. It is able to converge only because the problem is indeed an easy one.\n\n\n\nWe may record the curve of the cost function.\n\n\nAfter 200 iterations, the parameters are (2.291241352364798, 1.203587494484257).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cost is close to \\(0\\) after 200 iterations and seems to be convergent. Therefore we believe that we are close to the minimal point. The point we get is (np.float64(2.291241352364798), np.float64(1.203587494484257)).\n\n\n5.1.4 Summary\nLet us summarize the example above and generalize it to the general case.\n\nLet \\(\\{(X_i, y_i)\\}\\) be a given dataset. Assume that \\(y=f_{\\Theta}(X)\\) where \\(\\Theta\\) is the set of all parameters.\nThe cost function \\(J_{\\Theta, \\{(X_i, y_i)\\}}\\) is defined.\nTo find the minimal point of the cost function, the gradient descent is applied:\n\nStart from a random initial point \\(\\theta_0\\).\nCompute the gradient \\(\\nabla J\\) and update \\(\\theta_i=\\theta_{i-1}- \\eta \\nabla J\\) and repeat the process multiple times.\nDraw the learning curve and determine when to stop. Then we get the estimated best parameters \\(\\hat{\\Theta}\\).\n\nOur model under this setting is sovled. We then turn to evaluation phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe above process can be further developped. We will discuss many of them in later sections.\n\nThe cost function is related to each concerte problem.\nTo compute the gradient of the cost function, chain rule is usually used. In the setting of MLP which we will discuss later, the gradient computations with chain rule are summarized as the so-called Back propagation.\nWe go through the data points to compute the graident. How many points do we use? What is the frenqucy to update the gradient? This belongs to the topic of mini-batch.\nEven when we know that the graident gives the best direction, sometimes we don’t really want to go in that direction, but make some modifications for some reason. To modify the direction, as well as choosing the learning rate \\(\\eta\\), is the subject of optimizers.",

Therefore it is possible to get the partial information of the gradient by just looking at part of the data. In other words, the updating process can be modify in the following way: divide the original dataset into several groups, run through each group to compute the gradient with the data in only one group and then update the parameters. In general there are three types:\n\nThere is only 1 group: we update the parameters only once when we finish looking at all data points. This is the way we mentioned previously. It is called batch gradient descent.\nEvery single point forms a group: we update the parameters eachtime we look at one data point. This method is called stocastic gradient descent (SGD). Since we compute the gradient with only one data point, it is expected that the direction is far from perfect, and the descent process is expected to be more “random”.\nMultiple groups of the same size are formed, with a reasonable group size and group number. This is called mini-batch gradient descent. It is the middle point between the above two methods. The batch size, which is the size of each group, is a very important hyperparameter for trainning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteEpochs\n\n\n\nOne epoch is the process that you see each data point exactly once, no matter what the batch size is.\n\n\nUsually batch gradient descent is expected to have a more smooth trajection but move slowly, while SGD is expected to move faster to the minimal point but may never really get to it since the trajection is too jumpy. Mini-batch is meant to strike a balanced point by finding a good batch size. In the example below, we show the mini-batch gradient descent in the first 10 epochs.\n\np = np.array([1.0, 1.5])\nlr = 0.2\nbatchsize = 32\nRANDOMSEED = 42\n\nN = X_train.shape[0]\nindx = np.arange(N)\n\nnp.random.seed(RANDOMSEED)\nnp.random.shuffle(indx)\nbatches = []\n\nbatch_num = int(np.ceil(N / batchsize))\nfor i in range(batch_num):\n    last = np.minimum((i+1)*batchsize, N)\n    batches.append(indx[i*batchsize: last])\n\nplist = []\nfor epoch in range(10):\n    for i in range(batch_num):\n        dJ_i = dJ(p, X_train[batches[i]], y_train[batches[i]])\n        p = p - lr * dJ_i\n    plist.append([p[0], p[1]])\nplist\n\n[[np.float64(1.8396487079358765), np.float64(1.8350571390420554)],\n [np.float64(1.9759220547433842), np.float64(1.826737782139383)],\n [np.float64(2.0168483670845423), np.float64(1.7772907765564647)],\n [np.float64(2.043224019190362), np.float64(1.726425817587749)],\n [np.float64(2.065921614604292), np.float64(1.6790714304374827)],\n [np.float64(2.086528794877608), np.float64(1.635572387082582)],\n [np.float64(2.1053898608038017), np.float64(1.595691439736766)],\n [np.float64(2.1226730826892424), np.float64(1.559137786653576)],\n [np.float64(2.1385131544625695), np.float64(1.5256351733493791)],\n [np.float64(2.1530309370105214), np.float64(1.494929115540467)]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNon-shuffle version\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the result for the non-shuffle version.

    "text": "5.3 Linear regression (PyTorch)\n\n5.3.1 Construct torch.Tensor\nThere are multiple ways to construct a tensor. I just discuss those confusing ones.\n\ntorch.Tensor is the PyTorch tensor data structure. Itself serves as the constructor of the class, therefore you may use torch.Tensor(data) to construct a tensor. This is relative basic, and will have a default float type.\ntorch.tensor is the recommendated function to construct a tensor from data. It has two benefits over torch.Tensor: it will automatically induce the datatype from data instead of always using float; and it is easier to change datatype with the argument dtype.\ntorch.as_tensor is a function to construct a tensor from data. If the original data is numpy array, this tensor shares data with it. This means that if one is changed, the other is changed as well.\n\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport torch\n\nexample = np.array([1, 2])\nexample_tensor0 = torch.Tensor(example)\nexample_tensor1 = torch.tensor(example)\nexample_tensor2 = torch.as_tensor(example)\n\nprint(f'Tensor: dtype: {example_tensor0.dtype}, tensor: dtype: {example_tensor1.dtype}')\n\nprint(f'tensor: {example_tensor1}, as_tensor: {example_tensor2}, original: {example}')\n\nexample[0] = 0\nprint(f'tensor: {example_tensor1}, as_tensor: {example_tensor2}, original: {example}')\n\nTensor: dtype: torch.float32, tensor: dtype: torch.int64\ntensor: tensor([1, 2]), as_tensor: tensor([1, 2]), original: [1 2]\ntensor: tensor([1, 2]), as_tensor: tensor([0, 2]), original: [0 2]\n\n\nIn general, it is recommended to use torch.as_tensor over torch.tensor (since for large data to create a view is much faster than to create a copy) and to use torch.tensor over torch.Tensor (due to the benefits mentioned above).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteScalar\n\n\n\nA tensor with only one element is still a tensor in PyTorch. To use it as a scalar, you need to use itme() method.\n\na = torch.tensor(1)\na\n\ntensor(1)\n\n\n\na.item()\n\n1\n\n\nNote that for numpy, before 2.0 version an array with one element is considered as scalar. However after 2.0, it behaves very similar to PyTorch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotedatatype\n\n\n\nThe datatype in PyTorch is very strict. Many functions can work with only some of the datatypes. In most cases float and double are used. Other types may or may not be supported by a specific function.\nHowever, there are a lot of ways to play with types. For example, you may use torch.tensor([1], dtype=torch.double) to directly construct a double tensor, or use torch.tensor([1]).double() to first construct an int tensor and then cast it into a double tensor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteanother datatype note\n\n\n\nnumpy also has dtype setting but since it is not strict on it, we ignored it previous. Here is the case: the default setting for numpy is double type, or float64, while in PyTorch float, or float32, is commonly used. Since the precision is different, when cast from double to float, the number might be changed a little bit.\n\na = np.random.random(1)\nb = torch.as_tensor(a)\nc = torch.as_tensor(a, dtype=torch.float)\nd = torch.as_tensor(a, dtype=float)\ne = torch.as_tensor(a, dtype=torch.float64)\nf = b.float()\ng = f.double()\nprint(f'a: {a[0]}, type of a: {a.dtype}\\n'\n      f'b: {b.item()}, type of b: {b.dtype}\\n'\n      f'c: {c.item()}, type of c: {c.dtype}\\n'\n      f'd: {d.item()}, type of d: {d.dtype}\\n'\n      f'e: {e.item()}, type of e: {e.dtype}\\n'\n      f'f: {f.item()}, type of e: {f.dtype}\\n'\n      f'g: {g.item()}, type of e: {g.dtype}\\n')\n\na: 0.28093450968738076, type of a: float64\nb: 0.28093450968738076, type of b: torch.float64\nc: 0.28093451261520386, type of c: torch.float32\nd: 0.28093450968738076, type of d: torch.float64\ne: 0.28093450968738076, type of e: torch.float64\nf: 0.28093451261520386, type of e: torch.float32\ng: 0.28093451261520386, type of e: torch.float64\n\n\n\nYou may notice the difference from the example, and also take notes about the convetion of which setting is corresponding to which type. Note that dtype=float actually create double type.\nIn this notes we will use double type by setting dtype=float or torch.float64 to reduce the possibility of that small differences.\n\n\nWe now construct a PyTorch tensor version of the dataset we used in previous sections. The device part will be introduced later.\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport torch\n\nRANDOMSEED = 42\nnp.random.seed(RANDOMSEED)\ndevice = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'\n\nX = np.random.rand(100)\ny = 2.3 + 1.2 * X + np.random.randn(100) * 0.1\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=.15,\n                                                    random_state=RANDOMSEED)\nX_tensor_train = torch.as_tensor(X_train, device=device, dtype=float)\ny_tensor_train = torch.as_tensor(y_train, device=device, dtype=float)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBack to numpy\n\n\n\nIf we would like to turn a tensor back to numpy, usually we would like to remove it from related computation graphs and just keep the data. Therefore usually we would like to apply detach() method to the tensor before converting. Also later we will talk about devices. When taking GPU into consideration, we also want to send the tensor back to CPU before converting. Therefore the code to turn a PyTorch tensor to a numpy array is x.detach().cpu().numpy().\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 devices\nWe coulde use torch.cuda.is_available() to check whether we have GPU/CUDA supported devices. If the answer is no, we don’t need to change any codes and everything works fine but slow.\nIf we have GPU/CUDA supported devices, we could send our tensors to them and do computations there. Google Colab is a good place to play with it if we don’t have our own hardware.\nIn most cases we use to(device) method to send a tensor to a device. Sometimes some function has device=device argument to automatically construct tensors in a device. Note that if one needs to compute the gradient of a tensor and send the tensor to a device, we need to manually set requires_grad_(True) or create the tensor with device argument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteto(device)\n\n\n\nWhen sending tensors to other devices by to, gradient info might be lost. Therefore if we need to send trainable tensors to GPU some special methods should be used (e.g. setting device when creating the tensor). However for the dataset we don’t need to worry about it.\n\n\nHere are some examples, although they only makes sense in a GPU environment.\n\ndevice = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'\n\nt1 = torch.tensor(1, dtype=float, device=device)\nt2 = torch.tensor(1, dtype=float)\nprint(f't1: {t1.type()}, t2: {t2.type()}')\n\nIf you can see cuda in the output of type, it is a GPU tensor. Otherwise it is a CPU tensor. We may use to to convert a CPU tensor to be a GPU tensor. If this tensor requires gradient, we should set it manually.\n\nt3 = t2.to(device)\nt3 = t3.requires_grad_(True)\n\nIt is usually recommended to write codes with device in mind like above, since the codes work for both CPU and GPU machines.\n\n\n5.3.3 Gradient\nPyTorch can use autograd to automatically compute the gradient of given formula. All computations are done within the context of tensors. The biggest difference between PyTorch tensor and numpy array is that PyTorch tensor carries gradient infomation on its own.\nThe step is very easy: first use PyTorch tensor to write a formula, enable gradients on correct tensors, and then use the backward() method.\n\nb = torch.tensor(1, dtype=float, device=device, requires_grad=True)\nw = torch.tensor(1.5, dtype=float, device=device, requires_grad=True)\n\nloss = ((y_tensor_train - b - w * X_tensor_train)**2).mean()\nloss.backward()\nprint(f'db: {b.grad}, dw: {w.grad}')\n\ndb: -2.310644882519191, dw: -1.0130224137389\n\n\nWe could manually compute the first few iterations and record the results. You may compare it with the numpy implementation in Section 5.2.3. The answer is exactly the same.\n\nb = torch.tensor(1, dtype=float, device=device, requires_grad=True)\nw = torch.tensor(1.5, dtype=float, device=device, requires_grad=True)\nlr = 0.2\nplist = []\nfor _ in range(10):\n    loss = ((y_tensor_train - b - w * X_tensor_train)**2).mean()\n    loss.backward()\n    with torch.no_grad():\n        b -= lr * b.grad\n        w -= lr * w.grad\n    b.grad.zero_()\n    w.grad.zero_()\n    plist.append([b.item(), w.item()])\n    \nplist\n\n[[1.462128976503838, 1.70260448274778],\n [1.701791352506138, 1.7949449226054148],\n [1.8284450974134463, 1.8316393022111805],\n [1.8976247633456746, 1.840388291132826],\n [1.9375082488699051, 1.8352370440485253],\n [1.9623947070300602, 1.8233031967656035],\n [1.9795421883017095, 1.8081901205764057],\n [1.992636530631048, 1.7917185352872653],\n [2.003551206784623, 1.7748049887103945],\n [2.013240136591026, 1.7579075228763734]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe code has some tricky parts. The main issue is to let PyTorch know which gradient infomation should be kept, which should not. In this code, to make it run correctly, we need to pay attention to the following three things:\n\nBefore updating b and w, with torch.no_grad() should be used, to tell PyTorch don’t compute gradient here.\nWhen updating b and w, we should use the in-place syntax b -= db instead of b = b - db. Again, the reason is related to updating gradient: the out-of-place syntax b = b - db will lose the grad info.\nAfter updating b and w, we need to zero out the grad info by applying b.grad.zero_() and w.grad.zero_().\n\n\n\nWe will skip mini-batch gradient descent here, and leave it to the next section with a more systematic treatment.\n\n\n5.3.4 Optimizers\nAfter we get the gradient, there are still many tricks to move one step further. We already talked about the learning rate before. It is not the only case. Another example is that sometimes we don’t really want to move in the direction given by the gradient, but we want to modify it a little bit. All these tricks are combined together and are called optimizers.\nAn optimizer is a set of rules to update parameters after the gradient is computed. We already talked about SGD (stochastic gradient descent). Other common ones include RMSprop and Adam. In general, Adam is the generic best optimizer. If you don’t know which optimizer to use, Adam is always the go-to choice.\nHere we rewrite our previous code by optimizers. We use SGD in this example. Again, we may compare the results to Section 5.2.3 and Section 5.3.3.\n\nfrom torch.optim import SGD\nimport torch\n\nlr = 0.2\nb = torch.tensor(1, dtype=float, device=device, requires_grad=True)\nw = torch.tensor(1.5, dtype=float, device=device, requires_grad=True)\n\noptimizer = SGD([b, w], lr=lr)\nplist = []\n\nfor epoch in range(10):\n    loss = ((y_tensor_train - b - w*X_tensor_train)**2).mean()\n    loss.backward()\n    optimizer.step()\n    optimizer.zero_grad()\n    plist.append([b.item(), w.item()])\nplist\n\n[[1.462128976503838, 1.70260448274778],\n [1.701791352506138, 1.7949449226054148],\n [1.8284450974134463, 1.8316393022111805],\n [1.8976247633456746, 1.840388291132826],\n [1.9375082488699051, 1.8352370440485253],\n [1.9623947070300602, 1.8233031967656035],\n [1.9795421883017095, 1.8081901205764057],\n [1.992636530631048, 1.7917185352872653],\n [2.003551206784623, 1.7748049887103945],\n [2.013240136591026, 1.7579075228763734]]\n\n\n\n\n5.3.5 Use class to describe the model\nWe now want to upgrade the code we wrote in previous sections in terms of classes, since it is a good way to wrap up our own code.\n\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass LR(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs) -&gt; None:\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n\n        self.b = nn.Parameter(torch.tensor(1, requires_grad=True, dtype=float))\n        self.w = nn.Parameter(torch.tensor(1.5, requires_grad=True, dtype=float))\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        return self.b + self.w * x\n\nRANDOMSEED = 42\ntorch.manual_seed(RANDOMSEED)\n\ndevice = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'\nmodel = LR().to(device)\nmodel.state_dict()\n\nOrderedDict([('b', tensor(1., dtype=torch.float64)),\n             ('w', tensor(1.5000, dtype=torch.float64))])\n\n\nWe could use model.state_dict() to look at the parameters of the model.

PyTorch provides many standard modules that we can use directly. For example, the linear regression model can be found in nn.modules as Linear, while our loss function is the mean square differene function which is MSELoss from nn.\n\nfrom torch.nn.modules import Linear\nfrom torch.nn import MSELoss\n\nclass BetterLR(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs) -&gt; None:\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n\n        self.linear = Linear(in_features=1, out_features=1)\n        self.linear.bias = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.tensor([1.0], dtype=float))\n        self.linear.weight = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.tensor([[1.5]], dtype=float))\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        return self.linear(x)\n\nlr = 0.2\n\ndevice = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'\nmodel2 = BetterLR().to(device)\noptimizer2 = SGD(model2.parameters(), lr=lr)\n\nepoch_num = 10\nplist = []\n\nfor epoch in range(epoch_num):\n    model2.train()\n\n    yhat = model2(X_tensor_train.reshape(-1, 1))\n    loss2 = MSELoss(reduction='mean')(yhat, y_tensor_train.reshape(-1, 1))\n    loss2.backward()\n    optimizer2.step()\n    optimizer2.zero_grad()\n    p = model2.state_dict()\n    plist.append([p['linear.bias'].item(), p['linear.weight'].item()])\n\nplist\n\n[[1.462128976503838, 1.70260448274778],\n [1.701791352506138, 1.7949449226054148],\n [1.8284450974134463, 1.8316393022111805],\n [1.8976247633456746, 1.840388291132826],\n [1.9375082488699051, 1.8352370440485253],\n [1.9623947070300602, 1.8233031967656035],\n [1.9795421883017095, 1.8081901205764057],\n [1.992636530631048, 1.7917185352872653],\n [2.003551206784623, 1.7748049887103945],\n [2.013240136591026, 1.7579075228763734]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteInitialize the parameters\n\n\n\nIn all our examples we initialize the parameters to be \\((1, 1.5)\\) for the purpose of comparision. In most cases, we don’t manually set the intial values, but use random numbers. In this case, we simply delete the manual codes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nNote that if we directly change our function to the standard one we will encounter some issues. The main reason is that our previous code is an oversimplifed version that we treat b and w as two scalars. They are scalars in our particular problem, but it is better to treat them as a special case of tensors for the purpose of better generalization. Actually based on the standard functions from PyTorch (as well as many others like sklearn) X and y are expected to be 2D tensors. This is the reason why there are some strange reshape(-1, 1 ) in the codes.\nWe will reconstruct it in the later sections.",

In this chpater our idea is to treat it as the simplest example of a neural network instead of using other methods. The code we developped in the last chapter will be used extensively.\nAssume that we have a binary classfification problem with \\(N\\) features. Our model starts from the logit instead of the label \\(y\\) itself.\n\\[\nlogit(y)=\\theta_0+\\sum_{j=1}^N\\theta_jx_j.\n\\]\nThe logit function is used to describe the logorithm of the binary odds. The odd ratio is the ratio between the probability of success and the probability of failure. Assume the probability of success is \\(p\\). Then\n\\[\noddratio(p)=\\frac{p}{1-p},\\quad logit(p)=z = \\log\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right).\n\\] We could solve the logit function, and get its inverse: the function is the Sigmoid function. Once we have the logit value, we could use it to get the probability. \\[\np=\\sigma(z)=\\frac{1}{1+\\mathrm{e}^{-z}}.\n\\]\nTherefore the model for Logistic regression is as follows:\n\\[\np=\\sigma(L(x))=\\sigma\\left(\\theta_0+\\sum_{j=1}^n\\theta_jx_j\\right)=\\sigma\\left(\\Theta \\hat{x}^T\\right).\n\\]",

    "text": "6.2 Regularization\n\n6.2.1 Three types of errors\nEvery estimator has its advantages and drawbacks. Its generalization error can be decomposed in terms of bias, variance and noise. The bias of an estimator is its average error for different training sets. The variance of an estimator indicates how sensitive it is to varying training sets. Noise is a property of the data.\n\n\n6.2.2 Underfit vs Overfit\nWhen fit a model to data, it is highly possible that the model is underfit or overfit.\nRoughly speaking, underfit means the model is not sufficient to fit the training samples, and overfit means that the models learns too many noise from the data. In many cases, high bias is related to underfit, and high variance is related to overfit.\nThe following example is from the sklearn guide. Although it is a polynomial regression example, it grasps the key idea of underfit and overfit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 Learning curves (accuracy vs training size)\nA learning curve shows the validation and training score of an estimator for varying a key hyperparameter. In most cases the key hyperparameter is the training size or the number of epochs. It is a tool to find out how much we benefit from altering the hyperparameter by training more data or training for more epochs, and whether the estimator suffers more from a variance error or a bias error.\nsklearn provides sklearn.model_selection.learning_curve() to generate the values that are required to plot such a learning curve. However this function is just related to the sample size. If we would like to talk about epochs, we need other packages.\nLet us first look at the learning curve about sample size. The official document page is here. The function takes input estimator, dataset X, y, and an arry-like argument train_sizes. The dataset (X, y) will be split into pieces using the cross-validation technique. The number of pieces is set by the argument cv. The default value is cv=5. For details about cross-validation please see Section 2.2.5.\nThen the model is trained over a random sample of the training set, and evaluate the score over the test set. The size of the sample of the training set is set by the argument train_sizes. This argument is array-like. Therefore the process will be repeated several times, and we can see the impact of increasing the training size.\nThe output contains three pieces. The first is train_sizes_abs which is the number of elements in each training set. This output is mainly for reference. The difference between the output and the input train_sizes is that the input can be float which represents the percentagy. The output is always the exact number of elements.\nThe second output is train_scores and the third is test_scores, both of which are the scores we get from the training and testing process. Note that both are 2D numpy arrays, of the size (number of different sizes, cv). Each row is a 1D numpy array representing the cross-validation scores, which is corresponding to a train size. If we want the mean as the cross-validation score, we could use train_scores.mean(axis=1).\nAfter understanding the input and output, we could plot the learning curve. We still use the horse colic as the example. The details about the dataset can be found here.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nfilepath = \"assests/datasets/horse_colic_clean.csv\"\ndf = pd.read_csv(filepath)\nX = df.iloc[:, :22].to_numpy().astype(float)\ny = (df.iloc[:, 22]&lt;2).to_numpy().astype(int)\n\nSEED = 42\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.15, random_state=SEED)\n\nWe use the model LogisticRegression. The following code plot the learning curve for this model.\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n\nclf = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)\nsteps = [('scalar', MinMaxScaler()),\n         ('log', clf)]\npipe = Pipeline(steps=steps)\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import learning_curve\nimport numpy as np\ntrain_sizes, train_scores, test_scores = learning_curve(pipe, X_train, y_train,\n                                                        train_sizes=np.linspace(0.1, 1, 20))\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot(train_sizes, train_scores.mean(axis=1), label='train')\nplt.plot(train_sizes, test_scores.mean(axis=1), label='test')\nplt.legend()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe learning curve is a primary tool for us to study the bias and variance. Usually\n\nIf the two training curve and the testing curve are very close to each other, this means that the variance is low. Otherwise the variance is high, and this means that the model probabily suffer from overfitting.\nIf the absolute training curve score is high, this means that the bias is low. Otherwise the bias is high, and this means that the model probabily suffer from underfitting.\n\nIn the above example, although regularization is applied by default, you may still notice some overfitting there.\n\n\n6.2.4 Regularization\nRegularization is a technique to deal with overfitting. Here we only talk about the simplest method: ridge regression, also known as Tikhonov regularizaiton. Because of the formula given below, it is also called \\(L_2\\) regularization. The idea is to add an additional term \\(\\dfrac{\\alpha}{2m}\\sum_{i=1}^m\\theta_i^2\\) to the original cost function. When training with the new cost function, this additional term will force the parameters in the original term to be as small as possible. After finishing training, the additional term will be dropped, and we use the original cost function for validation and testing. Note that in the additional term \\(\\theta_0\\) is not presented.\nThe hyperparameter \\(\\alpha\\) is the regularization strength. If \\(\\alpha=0\\), the new cost function becomes the original one; If \\(\\alpha\\) is very large, the additional term dominates, and it will force all parameters to be almost \\(0\\). In different context, the regularization strength is also given by \\(C=\\dfrac{1}{2\\alpha}\\), called inverse of regularization strength.\n\n6.2.4.1 The math of regularization\n\nTheorem 6.2 The gradient of the ridge regression cost function is\n\\[\n\\nabla J=\\frac1m(\\textbf{p}-\\textbf{y})^T\\hat{\\textbf{X}}+\\frac{\\alpha}{m}\\Theta.\n\\]\nNote that \\(\\Theta\\) doesn’t contain \\(\\theta_0\\), or you may treat \\(\\theta_0=0\\).\n\nThe computation is straightforward.\n\n\n6.2.4.2 The code\nRegularization is directly provided by the logistic regression functions.\n\nIn LogisticRegression, the regularization is given by the argument penalty and C. penalty specifies the regularizaiton method. It is l2 by default, which is the method above. C is the inverse of regularization strength, whose default value is 1.\nIn SGDClassifier, the regularization is given by the argument penalty and alpha. penalty is the same as that in LogisticRegression, and alpha is the regularization strength, whose default value is 0.0001.\n\nLet us see the above example.\n\nclf = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000, C=0.1)\nsteps = [('scalar', MinMaxScaler()),\n         ('log', clf)]\npipe = Pipeline(steps=steps)\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import learning_curve\nimport numpy as np\ntrain_sizes, train_scores, test_scores = learning_curve(pipe, X_train, y_train,\n                                                        train_sizes=np.linspace(0.1, 1, 20))\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot(train_sizes, train_scores.mean(axis=1), label='train')\nplt.plot(train_sizes, test_scores.mean(axis=1), label='test')\nplt.legend()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter we reduce C from 1 to 0.1, the regularization strength is increased. Then you may find that the gap between the two curves are reduced. However the overall performace is also reduced, from 85%~90% in C=1 case to around 80% in C=0.1 case. This means that the model doesn’t fit the data well as the previous one. Therefore this is a trade-off: decrease the variance but increase the bias.",

    "text": "7.1 Neural network: Back propagation\nThere are many different architects of netural networks. In our course we will only talk about the simplest one: multilayer perceptron (MLP). We will treat it as the generalization of logistic regression. In other words, we will treat logistic regression as an one-layer netural network. Under this idea, all the concepts and ideas, like gradient descent, mini-batch training, loss functions, learning curves, etc.. will be used.\nTo train a MLP model, we still use gradient descent. Therefore it is very important to know how to compute the gradient. Actually the idea is the same as logistic regreesion. The only issue is that now the model is more complicated. The gradient computation is summrized as an algorithm called back propagation. It is described as follows.\nHere is an example of a Neural network with one hidden layer.\n\\(\\Theta\\) is the coefficients of the whole Neural network.\nThe dependency is as follows:\nEach layer is represented by the following diagram:\nThe diagram says:\n\\[\nz^{(k+1)}=b^{(k)}+\\Theta^{(k)}a^{(k)},\\quad z^{(k+1)}_j=b^{(k)}_j+\\sum \\Theta^{(k)}_{jl}a^{(k)}_l,\\quad a^{(k)}_j=\\sigma(z^{(k)}_j).\n\\]\nAssume \\(r,j\\geq1\\). Then\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\diffp{z^{(k+1)}_i}{a^{(k)}_r}&=\\diffp*{\\left(b^{(k)}_i+\\sum\\Theta^{(k)}_{il}a^{(k)}_l\\right)}{a^{(k)}_r}=\\Theta_{ir}^{(k)},\\\\\n% \\diffp{z^{(k+1)}_i}{\\Theta^{(k)}_{ij}}&=\\diffp*{\\qty(a^{(k)}_0+\\sum\\Theta^{(k)}_{il}a^{(k)}_l)}{\\Theta^{(k)}_{ij}}=a^{(k)}_j,\\\\\n\\diffp{z^{(k+1)}_i}{z^{(k)}_j}&=\\sum_r \\diffp{z^{(k+1)}_i}{a^{k}_r}\\diffp{a^{(k)}_r}{z^{(k)}_j}+\\sum_{p,g}\\diffp{z^{(k+1)}_i}{\\Theta^{(k)}_{pq}}\\diffp{\\Theta^{(k)}_{pq}}{z^{(k)}_j}+\\sum_r \\diffp{z^{(k+1)}_i}{b^{k}_r}\\diffp{b^{(k)}_r}{z^{(k)}_j}\\\\\n&=\\sum_r \\Theta^{(k)}_{ir}\\diffp{a^{(k)}_r}{z^{(k)}_j}=\\Theta^{(k)}_{ij}\\diffp{a^{(k)}_j}{z^{(k)}_j}=\\Theta^{(k)}_{ij}\\sigma'(z^{(k)}_j),\\\\\n\\diffp{J}{z^{(k)}_j}&=\\sum_r \\diffp{J}{z^{(k+1)}_r}\\diffp{z^{(k+1)}_r}{z^{(k)}_j}=\\sum_r\\diffp{J}{z^{(k+1)}_r}\\Theta^{(k)}_{rj}\\sigma'(z^{(k)}_j).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe set\nThen we have the following formula. Note that there are ``\\(z_0\\)’’ terms.\n\\[\n    \\delta^k=\\left[(\\Theta^k)^T\\delta^{k+1}\\right]\\circ \\sigma'(\\mathbf{z}^k).\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\diffp{z^{(k+1)}_r}{\\Theta^{(k)}_{pq}}&=\\diffp*{\\left(b^{(k)}_r+\\sum_l\\Theta^{(k)}_{rl}a^{(k)}_l\\right)}{\\Theta^{(k)}_{pq}}=\\begin{cases}\n0&\\text{ for }r\\neq q,\\\\\na^{(k)}_q&\\text{ for }r=q,\n\\end{cases}\\\\\n\\diffp{J}{\\Theta^{(k)}_{pq}}&=\\sum_{r}\\diffp{J}{z^{(k+1)}_r}\\diffp{z^{(k+1)}_r}{\\Theta^{(k)}_{pq}}=\\diffp{J}{z^{(k+1)}_p}\\diffp{z^{(k+1)}_p}{\\Theta^{(k)}_{pq}}=\\delta^{k+1}_pa^{k}_q,\\\\\n\\diffp{J}{b^{(k)}_{j}}&=\\sum_{r}\\diffp{J}{z^{(k+1)}_r}\\diffp{z^{(k+1)}_r}{b^{(k)}_{j}}=\\diffp{J}{z^{(k+1)}_j}\\diffp{z^{(k+1)}_j}{b^{(k)}_{j}}=\\diffp{J}{z^{(k+1)}_j}=\\delta^{k+1}_j.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nExtend \\(\\hat{\\Theta}=\\left[b^{(k)},\\Theta^{(k)}\\right]\\), and \\(\\partial^k J=\\left[\\diffp{J}{\\hat{\\Theta}^{(k)}_{ij}}\\right]\\).

Since we are going to use BCEWithLogitsLoss, we don’t add the final activation function here in the model, but leave it to the loss function.\n\nimport torch.nn as nn\nclass MyModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, num_inputs):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(num_inputs, 10)\n        self.act1 = nn.ReLU()\n        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(10, 1)\n        # self.act2 = nn.Sigmoid()\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.linear1(x)\n        x = self.act1(x)\n        x = self.linear2(x)\n        # x = self.act2(x)\n        return x\n\nNow we start to train the model and evaluate. Note that the majority part of the code is about evaluating the result. Since we are doing binary classification, our result can be computed by checking whether our model output (before the final sigmoid function) is positive or negative. This is where (y_pred_test&gt;0) comes from.\nFor simplicity, when recording the training and validating results, I only record those from the last batch.

After setting up, for this course they shouldn’t have any major differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteconda\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst go to the Official website to download and install conda. I recommand using miniconda instead of anaconda to avoid installing tons of unnecessary packages.\nWhen installing, please choose Just Me and Add Miniconda3 to my Path environment variable. (If you choose All users it is possible that Add to Path var won’t show up.) The Add to Path var is not recommended because it might be complicated in some situation, but if this is your first installation of Python or you want to mainly use conda it is completely fine.\n\nYou may need to restart VS Code after the installation. Then open a terminal and use conda --version to test whether the installation is successful.\nThen use the following command to setup the first virtual environment for this course.\n\nCreate a new virtual environment. Note that your name can be anything and is not limited to venv:\n\nconda create --name venv\n\nActivate the virtual environment.\n\nconda activate venv\n\nInstall packages.\n\npandas, matplotlib and scikit-learn are packages for the course.\njupyter is a package used to power Jupyter notebook as well as the VS Code interative window.

It is definitely not as good as the other tools, but in many situations that you cannot freely install applications this is your only choice. To use it, you should first have a Python installed. This Python can be from anywhere. For example, we could install it from the Official website.\nUnlike conda, venv by default creates local environmnet. It creates a folder in your working folder, and install packages inside this folder.\n\nCreate a new virtual environment.

So we first start a new folder (called the working folder) and all project related files should be put inside this folder. (There are ways to work with files outside the working folder, but you don’t need it in most cases.)\n\nThen you may create new files/folders or copy files/folders into this working folder. For demonstration a new file called helloworld.ipynb is created.\nipynb means this is a Jupyter notebook file (which is short for interactive Python notebook). This is the format for this course’s homework assignment.\nThis is the appearance of an empty notebook file.\n\nBefore using we need to attach the virtual environment we just created to this notebook. Click the Select Kernel on the right upper corner and select the environment we want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExpose kernels\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default conda creates global virtual environment while pip/uv creates local virtual environment. You may always use the following method to expose your environments to other projects when necessary.\n\nMake sure ipykernel package is installed.\nIn the desired environment, run the command python -m ipykernel install --user --name venv --display-name \"Python (myenv)\".\nThen you may find it in VS Code as the name “Python (myenv)”.\n\n\n\n\nNow we could start using a notebook. The best part about the notebook is that it can acommendate codes and narratives and outputs together in one file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteQuick Markdown syntax\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown is a light weight text format.

To use it you should have a Google account. Otherwise it is very simple to start, since a lot of packages for our course are already installed.\n\nA.4.1 Install packages\nIf you would like to install more packages, you can type the following code in a code cell and execute it.\n%pip install &lt;pkg name&gt;\n%conda install &lt;pkg name&gt;\nThe drawback here is that Google Colab can only stay for 24 hours. After that, all additionaly installed packages will be earsed. However you may put the installation code mentioned above at the beginning of your notebook and these packages will be installed every time you run the notebook.\n\n\nA.4.2 Upload files\nYou may directly upload files to the working directory of Google Colab. This has to be done in the browser. When working with these files, you may just use relative paths.\nThe drawback here is that Google Colab can only stay for 24 hours. After that, although your .ipynb files will be stores, all other files will be earsed.\n\n\nA.4.3 Mount Google Drive\nOne way to let the uploaded files stay in cloud is to upload them to Google Drive, and then load your Google Drive contents from Google Colab.\nGoole Drive is a cloud storage service provided by Google. When you register a Google account you will be automatically assigned a Google Drive account. You may get access to it from this link.\nHere are the steps to mount Google Drive:\n\nUpload your files to your Google Drive.\nRun the following codes in Colab code cells before you are loading the uploaded files:\n\n\nfrom google.colab import drive\ndrive.mount('/content/gdrive')\n\n\nA window pop up asking you about the permission. Authorize and the drive is mounted.\nTo work in directories, the most popular commands are\n\n%ls: list all files and folders in the working directory.\n%cd + folder name: Get into a specific folder.\n%cd..: Get into the parent folder. Then use these commands to find the files your just uploaded.\n\nFinally you may directly get access to those files just like they are in the working directory.",
