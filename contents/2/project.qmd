Handwritten example
:label: ex2handwritten
Consider the 1-dimensional data set shown below.

```{python}
#| echo: false

import pandas as pd
name = ['x', '1.5', '2.5', '3.5', '4.5', '5.0', '5.5', '5.75', '6.5', '7.5', '10.5']
data = [['y', '+', '+', '-', '-', '-', '+', '+', '-', '+', '+']]
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=name)
df.style.hide(axis='index')
```
Please use the data to compute the class of $x=5.5$ according to $k=1$, $3$, $6$ and $9$. Please compute everything by hand.

::: {#exr-ex2titanic}
# Titanic 
Please download the titanic dataset from [here](./assests/datasets/titanic.csv). This is the same dataset from what you dealt with in Chapter 1 Exercises. Therefore you may use the same way to prepare the data. 

Please analyze the dataset and build a k-NN model to predict whether someone is survived or not. Note that you have to pick `k` at the end.
