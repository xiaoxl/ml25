# Netural networks

There are many different architects of netural networks. In our course we will only talk about the simplest one: multilayer perceptron (MLP). We will treat it as the generalization of logistic regression. In other words, we will treat logistic regression as an one-layer netural network. Under this idea, all the concepts and ideas, like gradient descent, mini-batch training, loss functions, learning curves, etc.. will be used.
