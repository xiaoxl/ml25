## Exercises and Projects


::: {#exr-}
The dataset and its scattering plot is given below.

1. Please calculate the Gini impurity of the whole set by hand.
2. Please apply CART to create the decision tree by hand. 
3. Please use the tree you created to classify the following points:
    - $(0.4, 1.0)$
    - $(0.6, 1.0)$
    - $(0.6, 0)$

The following code is for ploting. You may also get the precise data points by reading the code. You don't need to write codes to solve the problem.

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
data = {'x0': [0.22, 0.37, 0.42, 0.45, 0.18, 0.20, 0.21, 0.23, 0.35, 0.58,
               0.60, 0.61, 0.62, 0.65, 0.70, 0.75, 0.82, 0.88, 0.90, 0.92],
        'x1': [0.83, 0.78, 0.65, 0.37, 0.57, 0.45, 0.67, 0.22, 0.43, 0.33,
               0.75, 0.50, 0.21, 0.31, 0.64, 0.70, 0.80, 0.82, 0.61, 0.81],
        'y': ['r', 'r', 'b', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 
              'b', 'b', 'r', 'r', 'b', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

plt.figure(figsize=(7, 7))
plt.scatter(df['x0'], df['x1'], c=df['y'])
_ = plt.xlim(0, 1)
_ = plt.ylim(0, 1)

```

CHOOSE ONE: Please apply the Decision Tree to one of the following datasets. 

- dating dataset (in Chpater 2). 
- the `titanic` dataset.

Please answer the following questions.

1. Please find the best hyperparameters of your choice.
2. Please record the accuracy (or cross-validation score) of your model and compare it with the models you learned before (kNN). 
3. Please find the two most important features and explane your reason.
